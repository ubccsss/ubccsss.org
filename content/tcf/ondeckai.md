  OnDeck AI makes visual reasoning systems that can find anything in any video, without training data. We help the Singaporean Navy find piracy or oil spills without training on their video, and just completed YCombinator (S25) in SF. Our core visual engine also serves customers in robotics, fleet management, asset monitoring, and environmental monitoring. We use bottom-up vision (VLMs) to convert qualitative information into quantitative and analytical results, with a combination of smart distributed infra and model component hacking.
