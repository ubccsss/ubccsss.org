  Our story begins in 1969, when Samsung was born with the ambition to help people achieve the impossible. After over 50 years, we're still innovating, creating technology that breaks down old and new barriers, and helping people to do what they can't. We continue to be driven by our purpose, so we seek to put people and what they care about at the center of everything we create.
