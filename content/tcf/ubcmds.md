  Data is everywhere. Continuously generated and collected across every domain, it is a vast and largely untapped resource of information with the potential to reveal insights about every aspect of our lives and the world we live in. However, the ability to uncover these insights is a highly specialized skill possessed by far too few.

  UBCâ€™s Master of Data Science (MDS) program is a 10-month program designed to address this workforce gap by equipping students with the technical skills, practical experience, and most importantly, the confidence to seize opportunities in an ever-expanding field.

  The program is offered at both the UBC Vancouver campus and the UBC Okanagan campus, with an additional Master of Data Science in Computational Linguistics offered at the Vancouver campus that focuses on equipping graduates with the skills to turn language-related data into knowledge and to build AI that can interpret human language.
