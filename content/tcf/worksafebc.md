    Our organization was established by provincial legislation as an agency with the mandate to oversee a no-fault insurance system for the workplace.<br/>
    We are committed to creating a province free from workplace injury or illness, and to providing service driven by our core values of integrity, accountability, and innovation. By partnering with workers and employers, we help British Columbians come home from work safe every day.
