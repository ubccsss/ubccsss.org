<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Launch Academy (startup-oriented co-working space) is hosting the &#x201C;Iron Hacker&#x201D; hackathon on Saturday, Dec. 8<sup>th</sup>. It&#x2019;s in the mould of Iron Chef, where teams only learn the theme the day of, then have the day to make an app for that theme to present to a panel of judges and peers for a bunch of prizes for whichever team makes the best app. Example themes would be &#x201C;Viral joke apps&#x201D;, &#x201C;one-player games&#x201D;, or &#x201C;dating apps&#x201D;. The theme will also not be specific to any API, so you won&apos;t be limited to whichever companies&#x2019; are sponsoring.</p>
<p>Format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hacker teams of 2&#x2013;4</li>
<p><li.you can="" do="" whatever="" preparation="" you="" want="" beforehand="" with="" your="" team,="" e.g.="" set="" up="" hosting="" environment<="" li="">
</li.you></p><li>After registration the morning of the event, the theme of the hackathon will be revealed, and you have until 7pm to work on your hack</li>
<li>Use whatever APIs, platforms, or frameworks you like to deliver your hack</li>
<li>All presentations must be done on an organizer&#x2019;s laptop: i.e. you need to demo something live on the internet. Exception: native mobile apps</li>
<li>Prizes awarded by judges based on how functional your team&#x2019;s app is and how well it corresponds to the theme</li>
<li>&#x201C;Iron Hacker&#x201D; trophy will be awarded based on by peer judging of your team&#x2019;s app</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep this developer-centric, we&#x2019;ve set up a couple hurdles for coders to get through before they can register (shouldn&#x2019;t be a problem for even novice coders): <a href="http://ironhacker.org/">http://ironhacker.org/</a></p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
