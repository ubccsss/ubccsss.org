<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>You are cordially invited to attend a special event at UBC&apos;s Faculty of Law: &quot;FREE SOFTWARE IN ETHICS AND IN PRACTICE&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Stallman will speak about the Free Software Movement, which campaigns for freedom so that computer users can cooperate to control their own computing activities. The Free Software Movement developed the GNU operating system, often erroneously referred to as Linux, specifically to establish these freedoms. This is a free event open to the public.</p>
<p>For more information, contact Penny Cholmondeley, Communications Coordinator at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#73101c1e1e061d1a1012071a1c1d00331f12045d0611105d1012"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="21424e4c4c544f48424055484e4f52614d40560f5443420f4240">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a> or 604-822-0846.</p>
<p>Richard Stallman launched the development of the GNU operating system (see <a href="https://gnu.org">gnu.org</a>) in 1984. GNU is free software: everyone has the freedom to copy it and redistribute it, as well as to make changes either large or small. The GNU/Linux system, basically the GNU operating system with Linux added, is used on tens of millions of computers today. Stallman has received the ACM Grace Hopper Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation&apos;s Pioneer award, and the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Betterment, as well as several honorary doctorates.</p>
