The Centre for Vision Research (CVR) at York University offers a one-week,
all-expenses-paid undergraduate summer school on the topic of vision science.
This year's program will be held from May 31 to June 6, 2009.

The program includes talks by CVR faculty members on current research topics in
vision science, as well as hands-on projects in CVR laboratories. The
curriculum reflects the wide range of research areas at CVR, which includes
basic research on vision in humans and animals, covering both neuroscience and
behaviour, as well as applied topics such as computer vision, virtual reality,
visual perception in low-gravity environments, and vision in clinical
populations. For an idea of the topics to be covered, see last year's schedule
at [http://yorku.ca/cvrss/schedule2008.pdf](http://yorku.ca/cvrss/schedule2008.pdf).
