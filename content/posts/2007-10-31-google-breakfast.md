![](/files/google-breakfast.png)Google Campus Ambassador, Yaying Guo, will be hosting a first-ever **Google breakfast** event on campus this November 1st. Come and join us for some donuts and some conversation - anything really :-) It's a little bit of a breather in between midterms and a good excuse to come in a bit earlier on a weekday than you might normally.

When:

Thursday, November 1, 2007 - 09:40 to 10:40

Where:

X-wing Lounge
