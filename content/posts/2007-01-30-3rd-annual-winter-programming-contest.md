We invite all primadonna coders, and all wannabe hackers to test their mettle in the **UBC/SFU 3rd Annual Winter Programming Contest**! You think you can code your way out of a paper bag? We doubt it.

We awaits you with 6 programming challenges to prove your worth. Solve them and you'll be a blip on our radar when we choose the ACM teams next fall; fail and you will not surprise us.

The challenge runs from **12:30-3:30** on **Saturday, February 3**. You will no doubt need help, so bring a friend and enter as a team. There will be registration and practice rounds between 10:30-12:00 (You can register by sending Matthew an email before, or come in during this period). The contest will be followed by **free pizza** and **prizes** from 3:30 to 4:00 pm.

Language: C, C++, Java \
OS: Unix (vi, emacs, eclipse, etc), Windows (dev-c++, eclipse, notepad, etc)

We will award prizes to those who embarrass themselves the least. If you have not previously participated in programming contests, this page ( [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~minsk/acm.html](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~minsk/acm.html) ) may be helpful for you. Please feel free to contact Matthew ([\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1974717a717877597a6a376c7b7a377a78)) for any inquiry.
