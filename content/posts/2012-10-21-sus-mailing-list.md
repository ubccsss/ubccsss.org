The **UBC Science Undergraduate Society** is starting an e-mail based mailing list for easier formatting & readability and access to a wider audience. This is different from the emails sent out through the Dean's Office, which are restricted in frequency and therefore contain limited information. Emails will be limited to, at most, 2 per month. We will not spam you incessantly.

**Description**: An informative mailing list from the UBC Science Undergraduate Society. Provides pertinent info about scholarships, sports rebates, academic info sessions & workshops, social events, SUS opportunities, positions, merchandise, etc.

You have two options to join:
