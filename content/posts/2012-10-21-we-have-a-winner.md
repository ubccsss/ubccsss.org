<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>After much effort and vote counting, we have a winner!  Leading the pack with 17 amazing votes is design #6.  Its graceful cubic lines evidently struck a note in the hearts of CPSC&apos;ers everywhere and will be featured on whatever products we can come up with this year.</p>
<p>We applaud the designer of #6, <b>Johnson Chuang</b>, as well as the 71 people who took the time to vote.  Kudos to the runner ups, #1 and #4.  Remember, if you didn&apos;t make it this time around, there&apos;s always next year!</p>
