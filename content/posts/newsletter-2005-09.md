Hey all you CSers! We hope you've all been settling into your new year of courses. Whether you're straight out of high school--looking like deer in headlights--or in your \_n_th year of studies, just hoping that you might finally graduate after five co-op work terms and going on an exchange to Japan, it would benefit you to make the most of things. That is, it is highly advisable to take advantage of some of the great events that are happening around you before midterm seasons hits and we're all peeling ourselves off the floor, trying to dig our way out as the walls of the basement computer labs seem to be getting closer and closer.

Congratulations to your new CS Year Representatives:

- Andrew Newman, 1st Year Rep <1styearrep(at)csss.cs.ubc.ca>
- Michael Chuang, 2nd Year Rep <2ndyearrep(at)csss.cs.ubc.ca>
- Arash Malek, 3rd Year Rep <3rdyearrep(at)csss.cs.ubc.ca>
- Charles Bihi, 3rd Year Rep <3rdyearrep(at)csss.cs.ubc.ca>
- Liza Ma, 4th+ Year Rep <4thyearrep(at)csss.cs.ubc.ca>
- Jake McRoberts, 4th+ Year Rep <4thyearrep(at)csss.cs.ubc.ca>

They will be helping to promote events and serve as representatives for your year of study. Should you have any concerns that pertain only to your class, you may contact them as easily as any of our executives.
