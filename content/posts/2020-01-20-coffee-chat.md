#### WHAT

CS Coffee Chat is a program that randomly pairs a junior (1st or 2nd year) student with a senior (3rd+ year) student for a quick meet-up on a monthly basis. This is a low-commitment and informal opportunity for junior students to ask questions about Computer Science majors, classes, extracurriculars, or internships and senior students to share their experiences! If more junior than senior students sign up, we'll make sure everyone is still in placed a match in a group of three - either in a group of three or with another junior student.

Make new friends and get to know other people walking around ICICS :)

We had a great turnout for both months, with 40 people in October and 84 in November. Since December is finals season, we look forward to picking this up again next January.

Every month, we open the form on first day and close on the last day. Matchings are then sent out to your email during the first week of next month. If you have any questions, reach out to ubc.cs.coffee.chat@gmail.com.

**Sign-up for the February 2020 round is now open, and you can find the sign-up form [here](https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aV1r4019aH8eiNf?fbclid=IwAR1l5NxwMZ33RBMep2qGK4W6KhMoHvXstvanxZ7ky2jl4SmYDFSnY5xk9nM).**
