The CSSS Executive Elections will be held on Wednesday, April 6th from 11:30am to 4pm, and Thursday, April 7th from 11am to 3:30pm (may be extended if the voting booth isn't open during those hours) in the first floor lobby of the Hugh Dempster Pavilion. All students registered in a Computer Science major program are eligible to vote in the election.

Here are the nominees for each position:

**President** \
**Janet Poon**

Hi all! I'm Janet, and I'm running to be your next CSSS president.

I've been a student in the Department of Computer Science for three years now, and I know that there is so much more the CSSS could do to support students in their social, academic, and health-related well-being. Some of the changes I want to see implemented are:

- Restore the CSSS Tutoring Board & the Past-Exams Database to full functionality.
- Provide a 'Students-Seeking-Students' board for those looking for partners for side-projects and startups.
- Reduce the duration of The Cube's Snack Shop stock-outs (can't have you starving during exam season).
- Host more casual events for students to hang out in and get involved with The Cube.

For next year, my experience as VP Volunteering (2014-2015) and VP Finance (2015-2016) will help the team keep offering awesome events and services, while seeing through new changes to make your experience better!

This year, we kept the Cube relatively clean and running smoothly. We acquired new and updated equipment such as a new printer and coffee grinder. We re-decorated and adjusted the room layout. In the near future and next year, we plan on increasing seating and replacing the last couch.

**VP Social** \
**Godot (Yuan) Bian**

I switched to BUCS program last summer, and I feel welcomed by CS since the first day of this academic year when I got to know CSSS. I am excited to be running for the position of VP Social. Speaking on the responsibilities of the position, I have experiences organizing events including annual literature competition, school magazines promotion and new year celebration for more than a thousand people when I was president of Literature club in high school. In addition, I have been a TA and a math coach at UBC.

CS is the most academically diverse department with students from a full range of backgrounds and perspectives. It would be my honor if I could contribute to CSSS's welcoming and comfortable social setting where common interests are discovered and shared. If elected VPS, my goal would be to create unforgettable memories, increase awareness of the club and its services through various social events.

**VP Volunteering** \
**Bianca Subion**

Hi! Although my name listed here is Bianca, most people call me Bea (BAY-ah). I'm in my third year at UBC, but my second year as a Computer Science major. I'm passionate about volunteering and am an avid advocate for giving back. As a volunteer board member at the Richmond Women's Resource Centre, I see firsthand the impact we make in women's lives by allocating a portion of our time to educate, provide services and organize workshops. I look forward to being able to make a difference in our Computer Science Department by getting more CS students involved with volunteering, and organizing opportunities for students to be able to give back to the community!
