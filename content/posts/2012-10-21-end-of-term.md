![](/files/thatsallfolks.jpg)Well, that's all folks, for term 1 at least!

Donut sales, LAN parties, BBQ's, tons of info sessions. We'd like to hear from you what went "right" for you and what you think we needed improvement on. Or suggestions on what you would like to see us do. Seriously, the sky's the limit here, and we promise to consider anything you bring up. There's still another whole term to go, and so much more in store for you guys, so please let us know in the Forums.

I think this was a really successful term for us, and we certainly hope we made a difference in your routine. Whether it was dropping by for a quick snack of ever-healthy potato chips and pop, or burning hours in front of our popular Xbox, or just socializing at one of our many events, it was all good :-)

So, now's the time to hit the books (in case you haven't done so already), and blast through 3 weeks of exams. Study smarter, not harder and may the force be with you... always.

_PS: If you haven't picked up your clothing orders by now, just drop us an email at [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fa99898989ba8e929f998f989fd4999b) and we'll try to arrange something. Or, if you're going to be busy, you can always pick it up in the new year._
