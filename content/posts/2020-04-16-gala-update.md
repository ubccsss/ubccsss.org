Unfortunately, given the move to online graduation, it is clear that we have no choice but to cancel this year's Year-End Gala. We recognize this will be disheartening news to many of you (myself included), particularly those graduating wanting to celebrate our time at UBC surrounded by the people with whom we've struggled together through undergrad and to whom we've grown close.

We're putting aside some of the money that we would have spent on the gala and looking for a way to commemorate the graduating class. In lieu of memories of one last night together, we want to give something that will serve to remind us of our shared experience. If you have any thoughts on what might be meaningful and valuable for the students and/or CS department, please find our survey here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKqGdo-5wLE-G6sDCadniGqT1puxqqUvbnYZaBoFJxCE_j0w/viewform

You will receive your full refund, the refund process will proceed in the next couple of days. For those who purchased group tickets, the cumulativeÂ amount will be refunded to the buyer of the tickets. If you have any questions or encountered any difficulties during the refund process, do not hesitate to reach out to us. Preferably through Facebook page, as our email server is down.

And if I might step off the official-voice-pedestal for a moment here -- I want to express my gratitude to the community. Throughout my five years around computer science, it's amazed me how many wonderful people seem to appear at every turn, and I know there are so many more I've never had the pleasure of meeting. Those of you who come with fresh ideas, new energy, and unending drive to better the student community and the department, thank you. And those of you who bring warmth, friendliness, and a genial word, thank you. And those who bring just your presence and your attention, thank you. You are all invaluable to making this department what it is. These are turbulent times; still, I know that next year, regardless of what happens, we will be here aiming to support you in whatever capacity you need. I hope we continue to further the goal of welcoming everyone with open arms, encouraging and edifying each other, and serving as your little beacon and refuge when it comes to navigating computer science student life.

Stay safe, stay entertained, and we can't wait to see you again -- whenever that may be!
