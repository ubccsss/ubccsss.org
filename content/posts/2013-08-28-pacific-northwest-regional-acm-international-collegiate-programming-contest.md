On November 15, for the first time, UBC is hosting the Pacific NW region ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest. \
UBC's teams have won this regional competition for the last five years (beating teams from Stanford, Berkeley, UW, SFU, ...) and gone on to the world finals.

We need your help to host the regional competition.

As a volunteer, you will get free food, a free t-shirt, and a chance to help run a major programming contest with teams from across the province. Please email Chelsey at: [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9dcc7cdccdbcedbc8cd84c0c7cfc6e9cada87dccbca87cac8) to sign up. We need people to assemble registration packets, register teams, deliver balloons and printouts during the contest, help with meals, and help make sure everything runs smoothly.

Volunteer orientation happens Friday evening, November 14 (with free pizza), and the contest is Saturday, November 15 (with free meals all day).

When:

Friday, November 14, 2008 (All day) to Saturday, November 15, 2008 (All day)
