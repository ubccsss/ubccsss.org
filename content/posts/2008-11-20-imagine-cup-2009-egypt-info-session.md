Hi UBCers,

Imagine Cup 2009 Egypt is upon us; I would like to invite you to a quick overview session I will be holding.

This challenge is open to everyone, undergraduate and graduate students.

**What is Imagine Cup?**

Imagine Cup is a worldwide competition held by Microsoft to give students a simple way to exercise the skills they have acquired through school. Every year, the competition is given a new theme for new set of problem to be tackled.

**What is it about this year?**

Every day we hear somewhere in our world, people are in dire need of help. People are starving, diseases ravage communities. Basic education is out of reach for too many people. Dangerous shifts in the environment affect millions as countries struggle to develop in sustainable ways. It seems overwhelming—but we can't throw up our hands and give up. The answers are all around us in thousands of ideas that happen every day. Solutions might be in the next few lines of code, a compelling photo or even a simple video game that can teach the world a lesson.

These small sparks set the world's imagination on fire and lead to change that really matters. Technology can be the force that transforms these great ideas into real world solutions. And that's the point of the Imagine Cup every year—to use technology to make a difference.

We need everyone—software programmers, hardware developers, artists and dreamers—to imagine a better world, then make it happen. The Imagine Cup brings together more than 200,000 students from over 100 countries around the world where they compete to help find the answers.

**What are the different ways I could be challenged?**
