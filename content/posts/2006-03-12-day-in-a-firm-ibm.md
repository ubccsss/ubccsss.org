Interested in learning what it's like to work at IBM? Why not go there and see for yourself!

The CSSS/MIS Day in a Firm is your chance to find out what it's like to work at the [IBM Pacific Development Centre](https://www-03.ibm.com/services/ca/en/innovation/vancouver/).

The Pacific Development Centre, IBM's Centres for IBM e-business Innovation, is an inbound solution development lab working with IBM Global Services to bring custom software solutions to the world. In fact, only 4% of the solutions produced at the Pacific Development Centre are for companies based in the province of British Columbia.

Excited? RSVP to secretary(at)thecube.ca by **Monday Mar. 20**. If you're without a ride, you can meet the group on campus at 8:50am at Bay 6 in the UBC Bus Loop. There are **only 30 spots** available, so act now!

Please note that business casual attire is recommended.

When: 

Thursday, March 23, 2006 - 09:00 to 11:00
