This is a call for students who want to get involved in
next year's IMAGINE event as Squad Leaders. Given that
our department admits students directly to first year,
we have a special CPSC Squad so it's going to be important
to identify a Squad Leader from our student group.

Check out the **attachement** to this post if you are interested, as well the deadline
for your application is **Octobert 30th**!
