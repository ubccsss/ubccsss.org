Do you have a background in computer science, engineering, economics, statistics, or other quantitative fields?

Are you interested in a career in consulting or business analysis and solve real business problems?

If so, we would like to invite you to an information session on the UBC Master of Management in Operations Research program.

Presenter: Dr. Derek Atkins, Director Centre for Operations Excellence, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia.

**Drinks and snacks will be provided.**

The 16-month UBC Master of Management in Operations Research (MM in OR) program trains students to become professional business analysts by providing rigorous technical fundamentals, practical consulting skills, and real-world problem solving experience.

UBC MM in OR students work closely with internationally renowned faculty, business leaders, and outstanding peers to develop and realize their goals in a professional environment. Each student receives generous financial support by completing an intensive 5-month applied project with an industry partner. MM graduates have excellent employment potential and embark on rewarding careers where they put their skills to use.

The MM in OR program is an ideal alternative to an MBA for technically-oriented students looking for a professional business degree that utilizes their quantitative skills. For more information, please visit [www.coe.ubc.ca/mmor](http://www.coe.ubc.ca/mmor).
