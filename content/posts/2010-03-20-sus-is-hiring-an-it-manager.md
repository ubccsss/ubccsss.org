The Science Undergraduate Society is currently hiring an IT Manager for the 2010–2011 year.

The SUS IT Manager maintains an internal server, as well as all of SUS' PCs and IT assets. Typical tasks include software upgrades, hardware acquisition, regular maintenance of PCs, and configuring of the ALSSC A/V room. The workload is generally low, but candidates should be prepared to, on occasion, dedicate a significant amount of time.

Technical qualifications:

- Windows XP maintenance and administration.
- Understanding of PC hardware and peripherals.
- Home networking experience: security, router administration, print and file sharing.
- Ubuntu Linux server administration skills are an asset.

The ideal candidate

- Will have some interest or experience in IT, and stays informed about new technologies.
- Must be able to perform with limited resources and an open mind.
- Should know when to ask for help.
- Should be able to explain technical concepts and jargon to a non-technical audience.
- Must have a strong sense of honesty and integrity. Quietly "borrowing" assets for personal use is not acceptable.
- Must be able to handle power and privilege gracefully.

This position includes honoraria, with the amount to be determined upon completion of the term.

The application deadline is **April 1, 2010**. Interested candidates should email a résumé and optional cover letter to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9cebf9fef1fdefe8f9eedcefe9efb2e9feffb2fffd), CC [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f8999c959196918b8c8a998c919796d68b8d8bb89f95999194d69b9795) and [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#1f7d727e717e787a6d316c6a6c5f78727e7673317c7072). Shortlisted candidates will be contacted for an interview.

Thank you for your interest in volunteering with the Science Undergraduate Society!
