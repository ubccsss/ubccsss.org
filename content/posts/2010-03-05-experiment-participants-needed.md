The Natural Language Processing group in Computer Science is recruiting participants for an experiment relating to analysis of meeting interactions. This involves reading and rating summaries of meeting conversations. The task takes 1 to 1.25 hours and the compensation is $10. We will be running the experiment for the remainder of the week, and through the middle of next week. Scheduling is flexible. Please contact [Gabriel Murray](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9afdfbf8e8f3fff6f7daf9e9b4eff8f9b4f9fb) if you are interested. Participants need to be at or near native-level English proficiency.
