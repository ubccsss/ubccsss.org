"**About FITC** \
FITC events. What's it all about? We've done 30 events over 8 years, through 30 cities and 8 countries, with over 700 presenters and over 14,000 attendees. From Flash to motion design, to Flex and AIR, to design and inspiration, FITC events stand as unique and exciting events that educate, challenge, and inspire. We also produced the Colin Moock ActionScript Tour with Adobe which went to 12 cities around the world, and also have worked with the Adobe MAX conferences in San Fran and Tokyo." \
