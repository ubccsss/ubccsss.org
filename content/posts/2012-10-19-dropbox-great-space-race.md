Dropbox is having a promotion right now. “Earn free Dropbox space for everyone at your school! Join Space Race to get an extra 3 GB for two years, plus the space your school earns!” At the time of writing, Dropbox is offering a whopping 8 GB of storage to anyone at UBC that participates—if enough people join in, that number could grow to 15 or even 25 GB.
