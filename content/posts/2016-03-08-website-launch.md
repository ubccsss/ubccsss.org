By now, you should have noticed the totally new redesigned website that is running. The server's now been upgraded to Fedora Core 4. Along with that, we've put in a CMS (Content management system) running [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org). Much of the content from the old site has been migrated into the new database-driven website, however, some pages are still rough around the edges.

The key element we're trying to emphasize this time around is **communication**. It is now easier than ever to stay in touch with what's going on in the world of Computer Science and at UBC. New RSS feeds keep you updated on important announcements that can be read with newsfeed readers such as [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/) and [NetNewsWire](http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/). The calendar generates iCalendar-compliant output that can be read with calendar clients such as [Mozilla Sunbird](https://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird.html) and [Apple iCal](https://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ical/).

Not to mention, the new Forums (editor’s note: now closed) finally gives a modern, convenient way to ask questions and find answers regarding a whole range of topics that is only limited by your creativity. And the good news is that you can access this with any (relatively) [standards compliant browser](https://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/). ;-)

Feel free to sign up for an account (editor’s note: public accounts now closed) and start posting! Any questions can be diverted to the email address at the footer of your screen.
