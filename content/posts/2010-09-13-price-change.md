<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>For years one of the most popular services that the CSSS has provided has been the provision of cheap drinks and snack foods to the student body. While we endeavor to the best of our ability to continue this service, the recent introduction of the HST by the government of BC has forced us to re-evaluate our prices.</p>
<p>In the next week or so you may notice that prices of certain items will be higher than before. Whilst we are aware that this change will be unpopular, our prices are still cheaper than the vending machines and food service locations on campus. We hope that you understand our decision and will continue to frequent the CSSS clubroom and support our society.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The CSSS Executive</p>
