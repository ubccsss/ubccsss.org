_"The Extreme Blueâ„¢ program is IBM's premier internship for top-notch students
pursuing software development and MBA degrees. If you're chosen for the program,
you become part of a team working in one of a dozen Extreme Blue labs around the
world. Your team's challenge: develop the technology and business plan for a new
product or service that addresses an existing market challenge."_

A couple of UBC students were accepted into this program last year, so if you are interested, click [**here**](http://www-913.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/index.html)
