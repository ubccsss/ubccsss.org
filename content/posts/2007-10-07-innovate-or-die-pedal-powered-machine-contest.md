![](/files/innovate_or_die.jpg) [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [Specialized](http://www.specialized.com/) are searching for the brightest engineering minds on earth for the first ever **Innovate or Die Pedal-Powered Machine Contest**.

We're asking students to invent and build environmentally friendly, zero-emission machines that transform human pedal power into a new and useful purpose. After you build it, you will film it and post it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) by **Sunday, December 15th**.

The Grand Prize for the most innovative submission will be **$5,000** and a **Specialized Globe bike** for the winner(s). The inventors behind the top 5 runner-up inventions will also receive Specialized Globe Bikes. This is an opportunity to flex your school's inventive muscle and have some fun doing it. And perhaps even help save our planet, one pedal stroke at a time.
