<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img src="/files/christmastree.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">By now, the initial excitement over the release of the marks (too bad they fixed that SSC bug this year) should have died down and the rigours of the holiday season should be taking over.  Whether you are reading this from abroad (lucky you) or at home, this time of the year is a great time to get back in touch with friends and family, and of course, do all those things that you didn&apos;t have time to do during the year!  Look at the numerous companies such as Google, IBM and Microsoft that are beginning to hire for those coveted summer internships, or express yourself in some of the competitions that are coming up fast, like the <a href="http://info.ea.com/company/company_tw.php">EA Tankwars Competition</a> or <a href="http://www.imaginecup.com">Microsoft&apos;s Imagine Cup</a>.  So, there&apos;s lots to do even if you&apos;re not a <em>keener</em> as someone explained to me the other day.</p>
<p>As always, we encourage you, during this bit of downtime, to give us suggestions as to what directions you would like to see <strong>Your Student Society</strong> take in the forums (editor&#x2019;s note: now closed).  And here&apos;s a sneak preview at a huge event that&apos;s coming up - the UBC Tech Career Fair 2005 which will be jointly organized with the UBC Eng/Phys and IEEE.  We&apos;ll do a big announcement around the start of term in a week or two. </p>
<p>From all of us at the Computer Science Students&apos; Society, we wish you a very <strong>Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</strong></p>
