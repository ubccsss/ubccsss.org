Dr. Peter Lawrence will be giving a talk in our Innovative Teaching Series this week. The talk will be of particular interest to faculty, postdocs and grads in Computer Science & Engineering but everyone is welcome to attend:

_Design-based learning is a new approach to engineering education that draws upon lessons learned in project-based learning . Emphasis is on motivating an integrated understanding of mathematics, science and engineering knowledge and skills through useful, interesting, and somewhat open-ended, design projects. The move is away from passive lectures towards group learning and design project work._

Specific goals include:

(1) Making learning more enjoyable;
(2) Improving knowledge integration between topics;
(3) Facilitating group learning and project participation; and
(4) Encouraging independent learning and research skills

Speaker: Professor Peter Lawrence, NSERC Chair in Design Engineering
UBC, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering

This talk will give insights into the benefits (and challenges) of establishing a design-based learning framework for the second year of the undergraduate engineering program at UBC.
