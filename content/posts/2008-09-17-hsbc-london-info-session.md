UBC Career Services would like to invite you to the HSBC London Info Session. Please join HSBC for an overview of our International Management programme. The presentation will provide you with information about the global opportunities available with HSBC, and a chance to speak with some of our International Managers about their experiences.

Headquartered in London, HSBC is one of the largest banking and financial services organizations in the world. Our international network comprises some 9,500 offices in 85 countries and territories in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa.

HSBC provides a comprehensive range of financial services to more than 100 million customers through four customer groups and global businesses: Personal Financial Services (including Consumer Finance); Commercial Banking; Global Banking and Markets; and Private Banking.

As the world's local bank, HSBC needs a group of highly talented, internationally mobile managers capable of working in any part of our business, in any location. The International Management (IM) programme offers a globally mobile, generalist banking career that is unrivalled in our industry.

We are looking for exceptional individuals globally to join us as IMs in 2009. If you have the talent, capability and drive to progress to the highest levels in our organization, and relish the challenges and rewards of continual change, this could be the right opportunity for you.

We are accepting applications at various levels, so whether you are completing an undergraduate degree, an MBA, or are looking for a career change, we'd love to hear from you. All applicants need a strong academic background, commitment to global mobility and fluency in English + at least one other language.
