The department is currently recruiting mentees and mentors for the tri-mentoring program. If you are a 1st or 2nd year student, you will be matched with a 3rd or 4th student, who in turn will be matched with an industry or faculty mentor. Joining the program is a great way for you to hone your communications, networking and job search skills.

If you are interested, please come to our info session and orientation on September 13. You will be learning more about the benefits and structures of the program and how it integrates with other professional skills workshops we are offering this coming academic year. We will also be giving you some training in networking and communication skills and providing you with information on how to apply to the program.

Monday, September 13, 2010 - 17:00 to 18:30
