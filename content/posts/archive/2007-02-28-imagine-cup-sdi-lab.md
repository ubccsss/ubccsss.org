Well keep reading...</p>
<p>Coming up is an Imagine Cup event to get you started on the <strong>Software Development Invitational</strong>. If you&apos;ve signed up and haven&apos;t gotten time to start on your entry, this is a last call before the deadline on March 4th. </p>
<p>Your friendly neighbourhood Microsoft Student Partners will be around to guide you through the process of signing up, getting started with .NET, and coding your way to the semi-finals in Toronto. Bring your laptop preferably or just come and watch.  The lab will be held in X350 from 2 to 5pm for the rest of this week (Feb 28 - March 2)</p>
<p>For those of you who aren&apos;t sure whether to join or not - considering only 60 of the 125 Canadian spots have been filled at this point, ANY amount of points will automatically put you on the leaderboard and a likely candidate and if Toronto isn&apos;t your thing, completing the first challenge will earn you the $20 gift card (did I mention we are showing you how to do this question?)</p>
<p>No RSVP necessary, just show up and knock on the door. If you have any questions, they can be sent to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#721f1b11001d011d140632061a17110710175c1113"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6b060208190418040d1f2b1f030e081e090e45080a">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a>.
