<p>We&apos;re asking students to invent and build environmentally friendly, zero-emission machines that transform human pedal power into a new and useful purpose. After you build it, you will film it and post it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> by <strong>Sunday, December 15th</strong>.</p>
<p>The Grand Prize for the most innovative submission will be <strong>$5,000</strong> and a <strong>Specialized Globe bike</strong> for the winner(s).  The inventors behind the top 5 runner-up inventions will also receive Specialized Globe Bikes. This is an opportunity to flex your school&apos;s inventive muscle and have some fun doing it. And perhaps even help save our planet, one pedal stroke at a time.</p>
