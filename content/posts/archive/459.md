<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Dr. Peter Lawrence will be giving a talk in our Innovative Teaching Series this week.  The talk will be of particular interest to faculty, postdocs and grads in Computer Science &amp; Engineering but everyone is welcome to attend:</p>
<p><em>Design-based learning is a new approach to engineering education that draws upon lessons learned in project-based learning . Emphasis is on motivating an integrated understanding of mathematics, science and engineering knowledge and skills through useful, interesting, and somewhat open-ended, design projects. The move is away from passive lectures towards group learning and design project work.</em></p>
<!--break--><p>Specific goals include:</p>
<p>(1) Making learning more enjoyable;<br>
(2) Improving knowledge integration between topics;<br>
(3) Facilitating group learning and project participation; and<br>
(4) Encouraging independent learning and research skills</p>
<p>Speaker:      Professor Peter Lawrence, NSERC Chair in Design Engineering<br>
                   UBC, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</p>
<p>This talk will give insights into the benefits (and challenges) of establishing a design-based learning framework for the second year of the undergraduate engineering program at UBC.</p>
