Are you looking for dry lab as well as wet lab experience? Want to build machines in a biological system using principles of computational design? Curious about what the interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology is?</p>
<p>The iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) of UBC Club is hosting our first icebreaking/networking event for all club members and individuals interested in learning more about biotechnology, synthetic biology and the iGEM competition. Learn more about the exciting and interdisciplinary field of synthetic biology from an engaging faculty member, Dr. Eric Lagally; meet the awesome members of the 2009 UBC iGEM Team; and learn how you can shape next year&apos;s team to succeed in iGEM, the premier undergraduate synthetic biology competition.
