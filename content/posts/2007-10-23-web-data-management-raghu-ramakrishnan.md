The Web is no longer a static repository of documents; it is a dynamic repository of information that connects people with their passions, and on a more prosaic note, the applications they use in their personal and professional lives. How is the Web evolving as an information source, and how does this affect the future of information discovery? What are the implications of the rapid growth of social networks? How does the emergence of the Web as a delivery channel for services affect the future of software? Technically, these trends have given rise to a new wave of challenges, and led to vigorous research on a number of fronts ranging from social network analysis, information extraction and community information management, massively distributed storage and computing platforms, as well as placing a premium on hosted service architectures.
In this talk, I will discuss these issues and outline some of the solutions that are beginning to emerge.
