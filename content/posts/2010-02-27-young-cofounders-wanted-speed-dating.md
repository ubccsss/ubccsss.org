On March 3, 2010 student entrepreneurs from across the city will be meeting to fuse their awesome business ideas with equally awesome talent!

Throw in some sushi, drinks & a quick chat from experienced entrepreneur, UCLA Alumni & founder of Silicon Valley startup [Viralogy.com](http://viralogy.com/) Yukai Chou, and welcome to the Vancouver's First "Young Co-Founders Wanted" Speed-dating session.

Unlike other networking events for entrepreneurs, the Young Co-Founders Wanted (YCW) Meetup group is focused on the needs of student or young entrepreneurs interested in running startup companies. Whether at the ideas or early-stage, YCF is aimed at being an extremely simple but effective way for student entrepreneurs across the city to meet.

[Tickets](https://meetup.com/Vancouver-Young-Co-Founders-Wanted) are $5 (9 spots left as of Friday, February 26); ticket price includes sushi appetizers & cover. The first 10 students will be entered to win a prize package of "2 Hours Workspace Time" from the Network Hub.

This Event Is For:

*   Student entrepreneurs looking for startup talent
*   Students interested in working on a startup
*   Early-stage companies looking for talented student

Why YCW?

*   Because many students and young entrepreneurs have ideas but don't know how to implement them.
*   Because crazy coders, ruby ninjas, and amazing designers exist and want good ideas to work on.
*   Because there is no structured forum to connect young people who really want to start companies.
*   Because there is no easy way for early-stage startups to find student interns or talent.

Be sure to [register](https://meetup.com/Vancouver-Young-Co-Founders-Wanted) now as tickets will start going fast!
