<p>We think it would be cool to create a button that would identify us as members of the Department of Computer Science and we want your creativity to come up with the design. What does Computer Science mean to you? We hope that the design is unique and would incorporate some aspect that would make sense in terms of technology, computer science, etc. </p>
<p>Submit your designs to nakisa AT cs DOT ubc DOT ca. It should include &apos;UBC Computer Science&apos; or &apos;CS&apos; somewhere on it, have no more than four colours, and be simple enough that the design is still visible when shrunken down to one inch.</p>
<p>Submit it by Thursday July 28th. Students will have the until August 11th to vote on their favourite design and the winning design may show up in places like on CS clothing, the agenda, the yearbook, etc. - so it better be good! Create a legend for yourself and prove that not only do CS students have brilliant logical minds, they are creative too! </p>
<p>Just for entering a design you will get one free &apos;beverage&apos; at our first bzzr garden, which will be early in the school year. The winner will receive a $150 gift certificate to UBC bookstore. </p>
<p>Thanks and we hope everyone&apos;s having an awesome summer!</p>
