![](/files/Logo_40wht.gif)Search has become one of the most important and commonplace activities on the Internet. Underneath the hood, providing high-quality search results in a fraction of a second provides a variety of challenging Computer Science problems. Such challenges include building and managing highly scalable distributed systems, developing algorithms for effective information retrieval, making use of large quantities of data for machine learning and trend detection, and designing user interfaces to provide information to users on a variety of computing devices. In this talk, we'll consider a sampling of challenges tackled at Google over the past few years, including work in scalable systems infrastructure, algorithmic developments for search, and innovative applications that been built using Google's computing platform. We'll also talk a bit about how much fun we have doing all this!

Dave received his MSc at the University of British Columbia in 1998.

**Gurmeet Singh Manku, Software Engineer** \
Gurmeet joined Google in August 2004 as part of the Infrastructure team. He has worked primarily on devising new compression techniques for massive amounts of data managed by Google. Gurmeet has degrees from Stanford University ( Ph.D.), UC Berkeley (M.S.) and IIT Delhi (B.S.). Gurmeet also worked full-time at IBM Research, devising efficient one-pass algorithms for data streams.

**Kelly Poon, Software Engineer** \
Kelly graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Mathematics, and from the University of Calgary with a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Computer Graphics. During university, she participated in the ACM programming contest as both a contestant and coach. She joined Google in June 2005, and since then has been working as an engineer on the AdSense backend team.

**April Yu, Staffing Programs Manager** \
April joined Google in August 2005 and works in the Seattle R&D office in Kirkland, WA. She manages relationships with U of Washington, U of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, and U of Alberta and also works on staffing programs for the Seattle engineering and sales offices.
