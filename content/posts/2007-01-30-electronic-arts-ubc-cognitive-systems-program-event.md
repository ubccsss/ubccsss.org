**Last day to register is January 31st, 2007**

Come to Electronic Arts Canada to here about
exciting research going on in Cognitive Systems
at UBC and EA. This is a great way to find out who's doing what,
and maybe get some good ideas for that research you're going
to have to do! (COGS students)

**Click "read more" for more information about this event!**

The event will have two parts:

- Part one will be presentations from COGS professors and students about research
  in the COGS fields (vision/visual HCI and Computation Intelligence/Behavioural Agents)
  and EA will have presentations on Athletic Performance (fixing the zombie problems),
  Wii controller HCI issues and HCI/UI design for the next generation.

- The second part of the event will be a social-networking event where students can
  mingle with EA employees. EA recruiters will also be around!

Students must contact Eric Lebeau ([\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) to register\* for the event.
\*\*\* Students must have membership in the Cognitive Systems Society (AMS club) to come.
Membership is $5.

###### Please note:
COGS declared Majors have priority, then students who will have taken COGS courses.
All others will be considered on a case-by-case basis. First come, first serve for
this type of registration. We have ~100-150 seats for students to fill, so there
will likely be space for you. The last possible date to register for the event is
Jan. 31st to make sure that EAC's security has plenty of time to prepare.
