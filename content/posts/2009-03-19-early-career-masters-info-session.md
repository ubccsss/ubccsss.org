If you are looking to complement your undergraduate education, you may wish to consider a one-year Master's degree in business immediately after your bachelors.

The Early Career Masters (ECM) is a one-year master's degree offered by the Robert H. Lee Graduate School at Sauder School of Business at UBC that provides a general foundation in business and management. Ideally suited for individuals with bachelor's degrees in non-business disciplines such as Arts, Science, and Engineering, the ECM program provides an opportunity to gain valuable business skills that are beneficial to a career in any industry or sector. Build on the investment that you've made in your undergraduate education, and increase your career opportunities. Upon completion, you will earn a Master of Management degree from UBC.

Who should consider the ECM?

*   4th-year students and recent university graduates of non-business programs
*   Candidates with limited work experience seeking to complement their undergraduate concentration with applied, relevant business skills
*   Individuals seeking to advance into entry-level management jobs/leadership positions
