Love solving tough problems? Know how to code? (Like free pizza? Want to visit Russia?)

Every year, the ACM ICPC draws students from over 1,800 universities around the world to rack their brains in intense, mind-twisting competition. For six out of the last nine years, UBC has won the regional contest. In 2012, we placed 18th in the World Finals in Warsaw, Poland. The 2013 World Finals will take place in Russia! Our secret to winning? Participation from competitors (new and returnee) like you! Come join us in the tryout!

### Why

Who doesn’t love tough problems and free pizza? If that isn’t enough for you: the top fifteen competitors from our local contests will go on to the regionals every November to match wits with Stanford, Berkeley, and SFU. Everyone will be welcome to show up to practice and improve their skills. Plus, if your team is top dog in the regionals, you’ll win a trip to Russia to compete for UBC and Canada.

Even if you don’t make the team, practicing will do amazing things for your coding ability: past UBC contestants have aced their interviews and gone on to internships and full-time jobs at Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Gotham Capital.

### Activities

There are weekly practices, usually on Saturdays. There may also be tutorials for newcomers. Pizza will be served during most meetings. When the competition date is near, there will also be weekday practices.

### Joining

Anyone is welcome to join our try-out and practice sessions. Feel free to join the Yahoo group. Contact info given below.
