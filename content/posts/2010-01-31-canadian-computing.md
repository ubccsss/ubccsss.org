St. George's school is looking for a CS student (either graduate or undergraduate) to help with the training for the Canadian Computing Contest (CCC) and possibly discussing enrichment materials with advanced students. We would likely pay a monthly honorarium of about $100â€“$200, depending on the amount of hours spent in training sessions. Candidates must be familiar with previous CCC contests, especially in the senior category. In particular, experience with dynamic programming and algorithm design is a definite asset.
