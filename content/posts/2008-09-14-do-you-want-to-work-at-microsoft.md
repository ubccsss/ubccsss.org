Want to be **sure** your resume gets seen by the Microsoft Recruiter?

If you forgot to bring your resume to MS talk or weren't able to make it, you've got another chance! Email it to Joshua Shrode at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject "UBC Resume". Please note that he will not be able to reply to everyone.

Remember, nobody has ever gotten hired without first applying!
