Are you, or somebody you know, interested in making a difference around the Computer Science Department? Do you enjoy leadership positions and the opportunity to give back to your community?

Every year around this time, we hold the elections for the following year’s Executive Committee. This committee, elected by their fellow Computer Science classmates, lead the Computer Science Student Society (the CSSS). If you think you, or any of your friends, would be a great fit for one of the executive roles then nominate them/yourselves!

Get your nomination form [here](/files/2014nomination.pdf), and have it back to Matthew Dorfmann by noon, February 28. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact `elections[at]thecube[dot]ca`.

Once nominations are in, we intend to announce the full list of accepted nominations by 1 PM on February 28, then have a campaign period March 3 through 10 and the election March 10 and 11. Votes will be counted on March 11 after close of polls.
