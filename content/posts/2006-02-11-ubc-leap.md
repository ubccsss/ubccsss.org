[![](/files/leaplogo2.gif)](http://leap.ubc.ca/) What is [LEAP](http://leap.ubc.ca/), you ask? According to their website, _LEAP: An innovative collaboration between students, faculty and administration developed to strategically coordinate the use of resources to better meet the learning and research needs of UBC students._ This is a fantastic resource site, launched by UBC and the AMS and looks to have amazing potential. The website includes many resources including a link to some upcoming workshops on study and research skills that are offered free to students and information about the completely new AMS online tutoring initiative. Sounds like a win-win scenario to me!
