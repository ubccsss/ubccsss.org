We’re passionate about web design. We want to spark a club offering web design services to other clubs, instructors, and professors, and to nurture a supportive community where fabricating good code and sharing ideas are just the starting point. To start, though, we need at least 5 more members. We’re recruiting web designers and graphic designers, but if you just want to join, that’s cool too. Email <club \[at\] lfred \[dot\] info> to join or to get more information.
