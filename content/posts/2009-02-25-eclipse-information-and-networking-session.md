Please join Wayne Beaton, Developer Evangelist for the Eclipse Foundation, for this evening of information exchange and networking.

Most of us are familiar with Eclipse as a free Java IDE. But there's much more to Eclipse than this: Eclipse is a platform for building applications, an open source community developing many varied technologies, an eco-system of companies that base their businesses on open source Eclipse software, and more. During this short presentation, you'll be introduced to some Eclipse projects that you probably haven't heard very much about, learn how you can leverage open source Eclipse technology in your own projects, and discuss the community and eco-system. We'll talk about both short- and long-term employment opportunities in the Eclipse community (including the Eclipse Foundation's participation in the Google Summer of Code programme).

We'll demonstrate Eclipse in action by showing how you can develop your own plug-ins to extend the Eclipse environment. Along the way, we'll show you some of the features that make Eclipse great, including refactoring, code completion, and Quick Fix/Assist.

We'll wrap up the formal session with an introduction to The Eclipse IDE for Education, a new Eclipse project that is concerned with improving undergraduate students' experiences with Eclipse. We hope to use this session to learn about your experiences with Eclipse so that we can leverage your experiences to make Eclipse better.

Networking with some local members of the Eclipse community will follow.

Food will be served.
