![](/files/sdi.jpg)Do you want $20 American Express Gift Card or an all expense paid trip to Toronto? Well keep reading...

Coming up is an Imagine Cup event to get you started on the **Software Development Invitational**. If you've signed up and haven't gotten time to start on your entry, this is a last call before the deadline on March 4th.

Your friendly neighbourhood Microsoft Student Partners will be around to guide you through the process of signing up, getting started with .NET, and coding your way to the semi-finals in Toronto. Bring your laptop preferably or just come and watch. The lab will be held in X350 from 2 to 5pm for the rest of this week (Feb 28 - March 2)

For those of you who aren't sure whether to join or not - considering only 60 of the 125 Canadian spots have been filled at this point, ANY amount of points will automatically put you on the leaderboard and a likely candidate and if Toronto isn't your thing, completing the first challenge will earn you the $20 gift card (did I mention we are showing you how to do this question?)

No RSVP necessary, just show up and knock on the door. If you have any questions, they can be sent to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#721f1b11001d011d140632061a17110710175c1113). You can find out more about the Imagine Cup at [http://www.imaginecup.ca](http://www.imaginecup.ca). Register with code "UBC" to be counted!
