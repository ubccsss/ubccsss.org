The 16-month UBC Master of Management in Operations Research (MM in OR) program trains students to become professional business analysts by providing rigorous technical fundamentals, practical consulting skills, and real-world problem solving experience.

MM in OR students work closely with internationally renowned faculty, business leaders, and outstanding peers to develop and realize their goals in a professional environment. Every student receives generous financial support by completing an intensive 5-month applied project with an industrial partner. MM in OR graduates have excellent employment potential and embark on rewarding careers where they put their skills to use.

The MM in OR program is an ideal alternative to an MBA for technically-oriented students looking for a professional business degree that utilizes their quantitative skills. For more information, please visit www.coe.ubc.ca/mmor.
