Delve into the cutting-edge laboratories at the University of Waterloo’s Institute for Quantum Computing during an innovative summer program that puts you at the forefront of science and technology.

The Undergraduate School on Experimental Quantum Information Processing (USEQIP) is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to work with the tools to harness and exploit the quantum world. You’ll learn from leading experts in the field at the Institute for Quantum Computing—one of the world’s largest research facilities devoted to quantum information processing.

The mixture of lectures and over 25 hours of experimental workshops offered at USEQIP are aimed at undergraduate students of engineering, physics, chemistry, computer science and math, though all interested students are invited to apply.

Twenty students will be accepted to the two-week program, with all travel, meal and housing costs funded by the Institute for Quantum Computing and their partners.

The program will include introductory lectures and hands-on workshops about such topics as: spin, superconducting and optical qubits, quantum cryptography, quantum error correction, quantum algorithms, decoherence and much more. Moreover, interested students can also apply for a summer research assistantship following the program.

The deadline for applications is March 4th, 2013.
