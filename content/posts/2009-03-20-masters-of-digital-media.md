Launched in September 2007, the MDM is a 20-month graduate program in digital media and entertainment technology. As an interdisciplinary program, our students come to us with undergraduate degrees in Computer Science, Engineering, Cognitive Systems, Visual Art, Business and so on.  The MDM is a terminal degree combining industry-facing curriculum, real-world projects and a four month internship. Graduates of the MDM will receive their degree bearing the seals of the four partner institutions. For more information, see the <a href="http://mdm.gnwc.ca/">MDM Website</a>.</p>
