Want to see what's up and coming in Canada's IT industry? The Canadian Undergraduate Technology Conference provides students with an opportunity to interact with the brightest student minds from around Canada, as well as representatives from North America's leading IT companies! Companies such as Bell, Cognos, General Electric, IBM, and Microsoft -- to name a few -- participated in last year's conference.

CUTC 2006 will be held sometime in late January. Students are responsible for paying for their own round-trip airfare (although CSSS may be offering some type of subsidy to help offset this cost). The Conference provides students with a greatly reduced hotel rate (the rate last year for staying at the Delta Conference Resort was $32/night!). There is a registration fee to attend the event, but if enough students from BC register the registration fees will be waived.

Finalized details about this year's Conference have not yet been made available. You can check out the CUTC website at [http://www.cutc.ca/](http://www.cutc.ca) - but please note that it is still under construction.

The Computer Science Student Society is willing to coordinate all arrangements for attending this year's CUTC. Please email [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ec8f99988fac8f9f9f9fc28f9fc2998e8fc28f8d) if you're interested in attending, or if you have any questions. In 2004, 15 students from UBC attended CUTC and had a blast - let's do the same thing this year :)
