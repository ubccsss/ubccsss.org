<!--break--><h3>President</h3>
<p><strong>Jenny Brook</strong><br>
<img src="/files/jenny_brook.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left">Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I am a fifth(ish) year computer science student here at UBC. I want to be your next CSSS president! I am in cognitive systems and currently working in my 2nd co-op term at QNX Wavemakers in Gastown.</p>
<p>I have been involved with the CSSS for the past two years now. Last year as Sport&apos;s Rep and I am currently one of your Social Coordinators. In that time I have learned a lot about what kind of responsibility and leadership are needed for the presidential position as well as balancing that with school work.</p>
<p>For next year I am looking to maintain the high quality events we already run such as the career fair, industry panels as well as continuing participation with tri-mentoring events and other committees.</p>
<p>I also think there are a lot more fun social activities that would be great for getting to know other people in your faculty. Things like BBQ&apos;s (with cheap food) and beer gardens (with cheap beer) are just some of the things I want to have more of next year! Competitions with prizes are also a must - We DO have an XBOX 360 with a screen and projector!</p>
<p>Make sure you come out and vote for all of the positions on our council!<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<p><strong>Yvonne Chen</strong><br>
<img src="/files/yvonne_chen.jpg" align="left" vspace="5" hspace="5">Choices, choices, choices, that&apos;s what we&apos;re faced with everyday.  Now make the right one, and vote Yvonne Chen for president!</p>
<p>I am a 4th year Double Major Computer Science and Biochemistry student, so I&apos;ve been around campus long enough to understand how things work.  The CSSS is about making your life better in Computer Science, and I am here to do just that!  Having worked at RIM (yes, the BlackBerry) and IBM, I will ensure more on-campus recruiting/career events, so when you graduate you will not be without a job :)  As well, with research experience and relations to faculty members, I will also organize events for those of you whose goal is to go to grad school after graduation!</p>
<p>Of course there also needs to be fun, and I will plan more social activities than ever!  Not just the pizza-eating/game-playing type (that&apos;s fun too), but activities that everyone can enjoy, including live band performances and sport competitions such as Ultimate Frisbee~</p>
<p>Whether it&apos;s industry relations or on-campus activities, I am well-prepared to work hard for you.  I&apos;ve been involved as an executive with numerous other clubs on campus, thus I&apos;m familiar with all the workings of student societies.  So come out on Election Day and make Yvonne Chen your choice.  I am ready to make the CSSS the best it&apos;s ever been :)<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<p><strong>James Lo</strong><br>
It&apos;s James.  If you liked Google and its prizes at the industry panel, enjoyed your experience in the Tri-mentoring program, and wanted better course scheduling for combined degree students, vote James Lo president!  </p>
<p>Several things I did this year as a CSSS exec were recruiting <strong>Google</strong> as a sponsor for the industry panel, working with the CS faculty to organize the Tri-mentoring program, helping out in various CSSS events (Career Fair and more) and sometimes acting as a cashier at the CSSS <strong>BBQ</strong>s.</p>
<p>They were me and Eugene last Tuesday in the BBQ trying hard to sell the boat cruise tickets :-)  </p>
<p>2007/2008 will be my final year working on a Combined Honours degree in Computer Science, Microbiology &amp; Immunology, with minor in Commerce and Co-op.  </p>
<p>As CSSS president, I&apos;ll continue building on my experience and relationship with both the faculty and industry to bring the best to CS students!  Having worked in UBC CS, Nokia, and MDA (a space &amp; defense company) I look forward to further collaborate with the industry (esp. Google) and ensure they are aware that we are one of the best of the best!  This year we&apos;re fortunate to have <strong>Microsoft</strong> sponsor the Tri-mentoring program.</p>
<p>Right now very few CSSS execs are in the combined program.  As president I will ensure students in the combined program are not under-presented, especially when the CS department is making <strong>course scheduling</strong> decisions.  </p>
<p>See you on Facebook.<br>

<h3>Vice President Internal</h3>
<p><strong>Eugene Chan</strong><br>
Eugene Chan is the incumbent Vice President Internal of the Computing Science Students Society. If re-elected, he plans to maintain a good working relationship with the department, continue to coordinate undergrad representation on department committees, assist other society executives with their jobs, and continue serving the general CS undergraduate population from the society office.<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<h3>Vice President External</h3>
<p><strong>Arash Malek</strong><br>
<img src="/files/arash_malek.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left">hey guys,<br>
I&apos;m Arash, currently in 3rd year of our favorite computer science program. I&apos;m also your Vice President External for this year. I proudly organized and hosted the annual UBC Tech Career Fair on January 25th 2007. I was glad to hear from the feedback I&apos;ve heard from both our department and the invited companies, that this year&apos;s Career Fair was one of the best in the recent years! I intend to organize our next Career Fair (happening early February 2008) by drawing from the experiences that I gathered this year, combined with many creative new ideas that will make next year&apos;s event even better! I have been involved with the CSSS for the past two years, helping out as director of publications for 05/06 and currently as VP External.  Allow me to represent you next year as well. Re-elect Arash for VP External.<br>
Your vote makes a difference because CSSS is your Computer Science Students&apos; Society!<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<h3>Secretary</h3>
<p><strong>Yaying Guo</strong><br>
Hello smart Science people,</p>
<p>I am a 3rd year major CS student.  In my 3-year university experience, I really enjoyed my life here and felt very busy and enriched. I joined in the Tri-mentoring program in the last two years, and already finished 2 co-op work terms in HSBC. My next co-op job will be in Alcatel-Lucent in Ottawa. Partook ImagineCup 2007 hosted by Microsoft with lovely and talented UBC CS students, I just came back from Toronto last week. (UBC CS won!! :-)) The reason for me becoming a CSSS exec is to do my best to help as many as CS students with my experience to solve their problems (since that is what CS students do) and enjoy their life, especially when they are facing problems with choosing courses and participating CS programs, like co-op program. I want to ensure that they won&apos;t regret for choosing computer science even when they are having heavy work load, and meanwhile, they definitely will have lots of fun in CS. At last, I want to thank CSSS for organizing the various CSSS events, like the industry panel, career fair, Tri-mentoring program, and etc. Thanks to these meaningful events,  I have realized that we have the chance to apply our knowledge to make contributions.<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<h3>Treasurer</h3>
<p><strong>Victor Chan</strong><br>
<img src="/files/victor_chan.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left">Do you want to see more free food? More free stuff? More free fun?<br>
Then elect Victor Chan for treasurer!!! I am a 4th year Double Major Computer Science and Biochemistry student. I will be running in this election, with one goal in mind and that&apos;s to find more funding so the CSSS can bring more events to everyone!  With my experiences with companies such as Sun, Google and Nokia, I will do all that I can to bring in external sources of funding to support our activities.  Of course it&apos;s not just about getting the money; it&apos;s also about managing it! I believe my experiences of running my own small software development team and being a Sun Campus Ambassador will allow me to carefully budget funds for the CSSS.  So if you don&apos;t want a regular book-keeping Treasurer, then vote for me, I will work hard to bring more to you!<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<p><strong>Jason Hui</strong><br>
<img src="/files/jason_hui.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left">Campaigns are all about empty promises.  I won&apos;t promise you the <strong><em>moon</em></strong> then deliver a <strong><em>rock</em></strong>.  I won&apos;t promise free food or free stuff.  After all, a broken promise is worse than no promise.  What I <strong><em>will</em></strong> do, is <strong><em>try</em></strong> my best to make it happen!  As a fifth year Computer Science student who&apos;s worked as a Software Developer at Business Objects and currently with Program Management at HSBC Bank, the world&apos;s largest financial institution; I think and dream in dollar signs!  I have demonstrated a strong commitment to the community through regularly volunteering at major community events such as The Pacific Spirit Run, Pascals Math Contest, The Wellness Show and many more!  With only seven courses left, I <strong><em>will</em></strong> have time for <strong><em>you</em></strong>, and not just the books!  It&apos;s not about me; it&apos;s about <strong><em>you</em></strong>! Vote <strong><em>Jason Hui</em></strong> for treasurer!<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<h3>Grad Representative</h3>
<p><strong>Richard Quan</strong><br>
<img src="/files/richard_quan.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left">Hi grads of &apos;08.  I am a fourth year computer science major and commerce minor student in co-op  graduating next year, and hopefully be representing the computer science grads of &apos;08.  I&apos;ve been to just about every kind of CSSS event there is over the years, countless job info sessions (sampling all the free food and free swag), and I&apos;ve also participated in the computer science tri-mentoring program.   I&apos;ve completed co-op work terms at the BC transmission corporation, WebCT Canada, and I&apos;ll be doing my final co-op work term at Telus this summer.  Next year I hope to represent your needs as a graduating class by helping to promote and plan more job info sessions, so that we can all find jobs before we graduate, and more grad social events, so we can all get to know each other a little better before we leave this place.   I spend a lot of time in ICICS, in either the lounge areas or labs, and I hope that any grad next year will feel comfortable to chat with me if they have any concerns that I can voice to the CSSS.<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<h3>Social Coordinator</h3>
<p><strong>Ilan Keshet</strong><br>
<img src="/files/ilan_keshet.jpg" vspace="5" hspace="5" align="left">I am a 2nd year Science student majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. In my spare time I like playing classical guitar, chess, table tennis, and volleyball. In chess, I have played it since I was four years old, and I have won numerous tournaments. For table tennis, I am currently the president of the UBC Table Tennis Club. In volleyball, I am a certified BC Volleyball Association local referee, refereeing over 300 games. I also enjoy volunteering, and have volunteered for PIMS Math competitions, Canadian blood, Van Dusen Gardens, and Science World. What else to say?<br>
For my Social Coordinator position for CSSS I plan to make events more fun! More movie nights and more LAN parties! Maybe even some free food events?! Everyone wants free food!<br>
<br style="clear:both"></p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Tantongco</strong><br>
Hi, CPSC (or roughly equivalent) majoring UBC students!</p>
<p>My name is Jeremiah. I&apos;m a first year CPSC major. I however would not like my experience at UBC to be just courses and assignment. Therefore, I decided to join up and volunteer! In my free time at UBC, I am either at CSSS&apos;s room or SUS&apos;s Ladha Science Centre. I have found there are many involved proactive people in SUS and would like to take that energy to my specific portion of the university.</p>
<p>Some things I would like to implement?<br>
Well. My first and foremost priority is to keep the Cube running as the excellent club that it is now. I&apos;m joining up to ensure that our organization remain the amazing refreshment dispensing, game appreciating social link between the students and department that it is now.</p>
<p>Secondly, I would strive toward more events with greater turn out. I also think that we should try to market our events to people outside the Department of Computer Science. A joint XBox360 Worms tournament with SUS when they get their gaming systems sound appealing anyone?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I haven&apos;t confirmed 100% for certain SUS is getting gaming systems. Even so, perhaps a CSSS Worms tournament?<br>
