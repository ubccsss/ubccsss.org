Hey Genius! Want a Prize?

Microsoft is looking for great candidates like you. You are smart, well-rounded, and well-networked across campus and we want to reward you for it. And it’s as easy as 1, 2, 3. Here's how it works:

1.  Reach out to your friends and classmates whom you know would be great candidates for Microsoft.

3.  Ask them if you can submit their résumé for a full-time, co-op or internship position.
4.  Each résumé submitted is an entry for a raffle. The more résumés you submit, the more entries you get. It's that simple!

Prizes include: Xbox, Guitar Hero, Games and Software!

Rules and Details:

*   Entries must be current students seeking full-time, co-op or internship positions in Software Development or Software Development in Test.
*   You may not submit your own résumé—so get your pal to do it!
*   Résumés entered will not be considered if the candidate was interviewed by Microsoft during 2008 or has an interview already scheduled in 2009.
*   Contest deadline is Thursday, January 22nd.
*   Entries must be e-mailed to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6501040b0c0009160c25080c06170a160a03114b060a08).
*   Subject line should read CONTEST.
*   Entries will only be considered once and any duplicates will not be considered after the first entry.
*   One of our current UBC co-op students will be drawing the winning names.
*   Contest winners will be announced on Monday, January 26th.
