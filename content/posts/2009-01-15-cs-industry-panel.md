The Computer Science department is holding an industry panel, and all undergraduate students are welcome! Come out, learn about potential employers, and don't miss the "speed-mentoring" networking session with the panelists and mentors from the tri-mentoring program at 6:30 in Reboot Caf√©.

The theme for this year's industry panel is How To Prepare Yourselves to be Future Leaders in the IT Field. The CS department is very fortunate to have recruited a number of senior industry leaders to share their experience with you, including the VP of SAP (former Business Objects), the CTO of Radical, the VP of Translink, and senior managers from IBM and Accenture.

Food and beverages will be provided!
