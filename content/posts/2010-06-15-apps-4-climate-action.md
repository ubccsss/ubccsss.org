[Apps 4 Climate Action](http://apps4climateaction.gov.bc.ca/) challenges Canadian software developers to raise awareness of climate change and inspire action by using [B.C. data](http://data.gov.bc.ca/) in new applications for the web and mobile devices. Aside from over $40,000 in cash and prizes, the contest is an opportunity for talented programmers to get considerable exposure across the country.

To help get the creative juices flowing, SAP is hosting a Hackathon for programmers in the Vancouver area. This is an opportunity for developers to meet, get advice from SAP engineers on data visualization and web services access, see new sustainability solutions from SAP, find collaborators for projects, and start CODING your app for the contest!

Full details and registration details for this free event can be found [here](https://hackapps4climateaction.eventbrite.com).

Look forward to seeing UBC's talent there!
