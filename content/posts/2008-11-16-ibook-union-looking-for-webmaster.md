iBU is the largest student-run non-profit bookstore that dedicates to lead a fair secondhand textbook market in UBC.

We are young, energetic and have a dream to break UBC bookstore's monopoly power and give students a fair secondhand textbook market. We are currently operating in a thousand textbooks every semester with a revenue of more than 10 thousand dollars.

Currently, we are looking for a volunteer position of IT manager who has strong web-building skills and can quickly adapt new team.

Some the most important tasks of IT manager will be to build a on-line communication platform (website). and help iBU to update its operation system.

The time commitment of this volunteer position is about 2–3 hrs/week.

Everyone who is interested in this volunteer opporunity is welcome!

And I am looking forward to see you.
