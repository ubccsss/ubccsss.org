Work online or onsite at your university on tough, challenging coding problems aligned to SAP’s business strategy including Analytics, Mobile, Cloud and Big Data. Joining an on-campus event you will also have the opportunity to participate in a competitive interactive Gaming contest. You can program the algorithms in different languages including C++, C#, Java, Ruby, Python, Erlang, and more.

For more information and to register go to the SAP Code Slam page at [https://sap.interviewstreet.com/challenges/](https://sap.interviewstreet.com/challenges/).

No matter if you are an experienced, international programmer, a student, a newly minted graduate or a programmer who looks to jump start a career, everyone is welcome to participate in either the virtual or the on-campus part of our Code Slam.

(NOTE: Exact times on Oct 13-14 still TBC. The Code Slam is designed to be a 24 hour-type coding challenge event. If 30+ UBC students register for the event, then SAP will host an on campus event for this. Otherwise, UBC registrants will work virtually on the challenge questions.)
