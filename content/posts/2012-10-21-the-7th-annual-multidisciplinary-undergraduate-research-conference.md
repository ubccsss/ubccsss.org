If you’ve been working on a research project this year, consider presenting it at the conference. It’s a wonderful opportunity to share your research, see what projects other students are working on at UBC, and gain experience in academic presenting. And it will look good on your CV too! All presenters receive a letter from the Office of the Vice President Research officially confirming participation.

For more information, please see attached flyer and visit the conference website at: [www.research.ubc.ca/murc](http://www.research.ubc.ca/murc). The website provides details about deadlines, registration, important dates for presenters, and workshops that we give to help presenters write their abstracts and prepare their presentations.

For now, here are some important dates to keep in mind:

1.  Deadline for applications to present is Monday February 11.
2.  MURC Info Booth to answer your questions—next week, January 14–18, main level of SUB
3.  Also to answer your questions, visit the conference coordinator, Sonja Embree, during her open office hours—January 21–25, 2–5pm. Address is below.
