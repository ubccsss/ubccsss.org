![](/files/ibm%20logo.jpg)David will be talking about four software labs in Canada - Victoria, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal - with a particular focus on the cutting edge work which is being done in Ottawa.

- Find out about the work being done in these labs and about the potential co-op and permanent opportunities with them.
- J9: the IBM virtual machine technology. It runs on your palm. It runs on your laptop. It runs on the worlds largest supercomputers.
- Eclipse: an open source, extensible development environment with base support for java, and extensions for Aspect J, C++, web development, workflow, or anything you desire, even games. This is the biggest threat to .NET today.
- Websphere Integration Developer: a new product built on top of Eclipse, which offers tooling to create e-business applications in a service oriented architecture. We push the envelope for visual programming. You can author your application using graphical data, interfaces, executable flow charts, state machines, business rules, and visual snippets.

This is an excellent opportunity to find out about the work being done in these labs and about the potential co-op and permanent opportunities with them.
