This year's graduating gift from Computer Science students will be a contribution to the
**Dean of Science Scholarship fund.**
Please donate and leave your mark on UBC by helping future students who are struggling
financially to reach their dreams.

There is no minimum so please drop by the Cube Office in ICSIS(X139) which is located right
across from Dempster and donate what you can **before April 10th.**

You can also make a one time donation on-line at [www.supporting.ubc.ca/classact](http://www.supporting.ubc.ca/classact). Click on
the 'donate now' button and specify Class Act as the campaign that you want to donate to
and mention Computer Science Class Act under gift designation.

**All donations will be matched by the Dean of Science, and the Head of the Department of
Computer Science, Dr Aiello.**

If we all contribute, we can make a big difference!
