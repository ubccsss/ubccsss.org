Attend summer school with no classes! Instead:
\*\*

- Get hands-on experience with mathematical modeling
- Interact with students, faculty and industry sponsors doing research in teams
  on real-world problems of critical interest to industry
- Meet students from around the world while working in beautiful Vancouver, B.C.
- $2000 CDN scholarships available towards attending graduate school in B.C.
  \*\*
  The MITACS Industrial Math Summer School is a new initiative aimed at providing
  undergraduate students with an opportunity to do mathematical research in groups
  on real-world problems. We will combine students from different academic backgrounds
  in teams of four or five to work on problems submitted by local companies, research
  labs and non-profit organizations. Each team will work for one month on one problem.
