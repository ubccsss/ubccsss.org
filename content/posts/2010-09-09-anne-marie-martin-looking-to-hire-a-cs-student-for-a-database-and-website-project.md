I'm a student at UBC (in the Arts faculty) looking to hire a fellow student majoring in computer science to help with a database and website project. The custom MS Access database currently handles customer profiles/orders, invoicing, payment tracking, reports, and inventory. Some new forms need to be created (mainly by importing from Excel). I also need to connect MS Word or PDF fillable forms (questionnaires) to the database (or to find a practical solution for emailing clients fillable questionnaires or designing web forms that can be easily imported into the database). In general, the database needs some updating to handle additional operations and fix a few glitches. This job may lead to a larger project, which would involve designing a software program to handle patient files for a holistic health clinic. Additional tasks may include: website development, website-database integration, and search engine optimization. This job is ideal for a student looking to build their portfolio with work experience/references.

The successful candidate will have a strong knowledge of MS Access databases and ideally he/she will be highly proficient in: software development, web development (HTML, PHP, CSS, DreamWeaver, CMS), and MySQL. Also, knowledge about decoding databases would be helpful, as I would like to integrate data from an encoded (read-only) database.

Interested students can forward their CV and hourly rate to `<ammartn[at]interchange.ubc.ca>`. Interviews will be conducted on campus.
