Career Services Interview Skills Workshop on Nov. 30th! It is the last Workshop for the term and we have a few spots remaining. One of the Employers who will be participating is Electronic Arts so it would be a great opportunity for students who may be potentially targeting EA as an Employer, to attend and meet face-to-face with one of their HR Recruiting Staff. Students also get a chance to practice their Interview Skills with the Employers.

Registration is mandatory: [www.careers.ubc.ca](http://www.careers.ubc.ca); click on workshop sign-up \
Cost: $10 \
Completing the online lesson (5.1) before the in-class clinic is strongly recommended.

**Only 3 spaces remaining!**

When:

Wednesday, November 30, 2005 - 13:00 to 15:00
