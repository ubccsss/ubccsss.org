The SCI Team's Get into Research Conference is the largest event of its kind at the university and possibly in Western Canada. Every year we show more than 500 students why research, in any field you can name, is the essence of any scientific advancement, and the foundation of any service to humanity.This conference will provide speakers who will inspire you with their research experiences. This conference will also educate students about research opportunities in labs, NSERC, Research Abroad, Industry, Grad Studies, Coop and more! This event is designed to encourage students to gain more out of their educational experience at UBC and get more involved in the research community. Registration opens soon at [www.sciteam.ubc.ca](http://www.sciteam.ubc.ca/).
