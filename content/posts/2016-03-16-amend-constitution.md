The CSSS has passed a constitutional amendment on March 15th, 2016 during a Semi-Annual General Meeting. This amendment affects the eligibility of Members to run for Executive positions.

In short, the CSSS will now allow two (2) Members to jointly run for a CSSS Executive Position, provided that these two Members are nominated as a joint ballot and subject to the conditions specified in the constitutional amendment.

The full text of the amendment is attached below. The updated constitution will be uploaded on our [Constitution page](/club/about/constitution) once it is available.
