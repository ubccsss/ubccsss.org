MusicBox Children's Charity is a non profit registered charity dedicated to providing music lessons (e.g. choir, private lessons, etc) to children in the inner-city community. We are currently in a partnership with the RayCam Community Centre where programs are being run every Wednesday and Saturday. We are looking for a Webmaster to work with the executive team to create a website. The Webmaster will be responsible for updating, improving, managing, etc. the website.

If interested, please send Ian W. an email at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4d243a257e7e0d252239202c2421632e2220) with your résumé.

Thanks, \
