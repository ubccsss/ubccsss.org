We are looking to interview current 3rd and 4th year students in any UBC CS undergraduate degree program (e.g. BSc in CS, Combined Majors, BUCS, Cognitive Systems - Computational Intelligence and Design, etc) about your experiences in your CS program.

The interviews will last about an hour, and will be scheduled at a time that is convenient for participants. We are able to compensate participants $20 cash for their time.

If you have any questions, please contact Alice Campbell, Science Education Specialist, Department of Computer Science, UBC. alicecam@cs.ubc.ca
