Nominations for the **2006 Faculty of Science Student Service Awards** are due March 6. All departments have been asked to let their corresponding student society know about these awards. If you, or any other undergraduate, would like to nominate someone for one of these awards, please let [Paul Carter](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d5a5b6b4a7a1b0a795b6a6fba0b7b6fbb6b4) know no later than **Wednesday, February 22**. Your nomination should include a 1-page description that indicates how the nominee has gone beyond the call of duty in their contributions to the department or the university as a whole.
