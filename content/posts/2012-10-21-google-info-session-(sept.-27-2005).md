Google is headed your way!

Not only are we coming to campus, we're busy solving a bunch of problems that might interest you too. Problems in global information access. Natural language processing. Large-scale system design. Machine translation. Artificial intelligence.

But it's not all work. Google offers great benefits, collegial environments, and plenty of smart people to hang with.

Sound appealing? We really want to meet software engineers who are burning to solve big problems—and who wouldn't mind working where great solutions are happily rewarded.

To apply, send your resume AND copies of your unofficial transcripts to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#72111d1e1e171517181d10015927303132151d1d151e175c111d1f). Please write "Software Engineer" in the subject line. [http://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/answer.py?answer=25515](https://www.google.com/support/jobs/bin/answer.py?answer=25515)

Want to find out more? We'll be hosting an event at UBC where you can meet Google engineers and learn first-hand what it is like to work at our extraordinary company.
