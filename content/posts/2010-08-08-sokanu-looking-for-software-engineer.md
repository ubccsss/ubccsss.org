### Who We Are

Sokanu is a social learning platform aimed at helping people find their passion in
life. We believe that people have talents and are passionate about many things, but often
don’t know how to translate that passion into a career they love. Sokanu will combine a
social networking platform with an adaptive learning engine to provide a unique
experience to each user.

### What We're Looking For

We are seeking a versatile and experienced software engineer to finish our alpha product
with code that is clean, functional, and easy to maintain. You'll be extending Sokanu’s
content platforms in new directions, as well as streamlining and re-factoring our existing
systems. We plan on growing by leaps and bounds, so candidates should thrive in
dynamic environments where development is fast and the only constant is change. You
should also believe in open platforms and want the development community at large to
build off your successes via open standards and API’s.

### You should have in-depth knowledge of

- CMS best practices
- The in’s and out’s of popular open source CMS and blog platforms
- Collecting community-crafted content and how to integrate it with internal CMS workflows
- Video platforms such as YouTube, Blip.tv, and others
- Mass distribution email systems
- Preferable knowledge in .NET, C# and SQL
- Database scaling at the application level and caching approaches, from object caching to CDNs
- RESTful web services APIs for developers, both building & using them
- Performance tuning web applications from the frontend to the backend
- Scale and what it takes to be successful at a community-driven web site where the word “millions” is used frequently and in many contexts

### Bonus experience

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript and associated frameworks (jQuery, prototype, YUI)
- Artificial Intelligence knowledge, experience with Self-Organizing Maps/Kohonen Networks, Neural Networks, Adaptive Decision-Engines, etc.…
- Social networking applications and associated design patterns
- Abuse and anti-spam approaches and technologies
- Ideally, you hold a B.S. or M.S in Computer Science, or have equivalent self-directed study and experience.

### Also important

- Shipping: you can point to products on the web today that you built and shipped
- Love of the web and a sense of fascination with the endless possibilities it creates
- Love creating products that are extremely easy to use and applying psychology to UX/UI
- A sense of humour
- Excellent communication skills

### Next Steps

If you’re interested in joining the team at Sokanu, please send a cover letter along with
your résumé to [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#402a2f223300332f2b212e356e232f2d) telling us what inspires you about Sokanu and why you think you are a perfect fit. If you contribute to an open source project, write a blog, or practice another craft besides software, that means something to us, and we would love to hear about it!
