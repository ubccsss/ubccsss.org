Hey all,

As the sponsor of Canada's Top Employers for Young People 2010, KPMG wants to hear from students what they feel makes a top employer.

The student with the best answer will win 5, one hour meetings with 5 top executives to be announced from the list of Canada's Top Employer of Young People Award (http://www.canadastop100.com/young\_people/) and an iPad 3G.

We already have over 250 videos posted.

This is an opportunity for your students to be heard. All answers are being documented and a final summary of students' answers will be presented at the Top Employer's Summit November 1-2 in Toronto.
