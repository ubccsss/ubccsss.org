Thanks to everyone who voted and ran, congratulations to the winners, and good luck to next year's executive! The new executives will take power on May 1, 2010, with the exception of the treasurer who will take power at the time of treasurer orientations with the AMS Finance Commission.

Note that as there was a tie for the position of Secretary, unless affected by a recount, there will be _no_ secretary in the executive-elect. The new executive may appoint a secretary once it takes power.
