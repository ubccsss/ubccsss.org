You&apos;re probably having the heebie-jeebies at the thought of spending endless hours studying. Why not add a little spice to your school year by joining one of the department&apos;s many committees and have a voice in departmental affairs? You will be able to work with awesome people (both faculty members and students) and develop soft skills you need to compete in today&apos;s job market. Please take the time to sift through the great selection of committees below. However, the earlier you apply, the better the chance you&apos;ll get the position you want.
