[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) is a series of career shadowing events that will give a small group
of students an opportunity to spend 1-2 hours with a researcher in a medical
informatics field. If you are interested in computational biology research, this is
your opportunity to meet Dr. Wasserman and find out more about his work environment,
academic background and daily activities. In addition, you may also get a tour of his
lab and department.

If you are interested in participating in this event, please e-mail us at
