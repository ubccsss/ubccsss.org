Eclipse DemoCamp is a free informal event for Eclipse enthusiasts to meet up and demo what they are doing with Eclipse (such as: research projects, Eclipse open source projects, applications based on Eclipse, commercial products using Eclipse, etc.). There will be presentations about cutting-edge JVM languages, custom Eclipse distributions, integrating agile processes into Eclipse, and of course some great research from UBC students. Free snacks and great networking guaranteed.

Those interested in attending should add their name to the [list of attendees](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse_DemoCamps_Helios_2010/Vancouver) or e-mail one of the organizers listed on that page.

Some of the presenters are your fellow Computer Science students!
