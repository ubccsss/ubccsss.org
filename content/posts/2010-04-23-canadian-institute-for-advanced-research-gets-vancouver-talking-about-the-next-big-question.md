This spring, the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) is taking the best and brightest minds out of their labs and offices to tour the country, challenging Canadians to think about the biggest questions facing our world today.

In Vancouver, at an event moderated by CBC Radio’s Early Edition host Rick Cluff, three CIFAR researchers will make a case for why their research area represents the Next Big Question. The people of Vancouver will be able to join in the discussion and vote for the researcher who best makes their case.

In Vancouver, the following _Next Big Questions_ will be championed:

Can we sustain the information revolution?

By Don Eigler, expert on the physics of nanometer-scale structures and exploring the applications of nanometer-scale structures to computing

What is the fate of the universe?

By Julio Navarro, expert on the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies

How can political institutions best promote peace and prosperity?

By Jim Fearon, Professor of Humanities and Sciences and Chair of the Department of Political Science at Stanford University

Tickets are $30 and can be bought at [cifarNBQ.ca](http://cifarnbq.ca/). Seating is limited and you must have tickets in advance to attend.
