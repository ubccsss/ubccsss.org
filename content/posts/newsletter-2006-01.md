**CSSS Games and Movie Night**

_When: Friday Jan. 20, 5:00-10:00pm \
Games: CS Undergrad Lounge \
Movie: Dempster Pavilion, Room 110_

Yes, it's back!

The CS games night is **tentatively scheduled for January 20th**. Last time, there were even more games than before, with poker players, lots and lots of foosball, Xbox, Risk, and general silliness.

Expect there to be satisfying nourishment (for a very reasonable price) and a break at just the point in the term where you begin to want for it to be over. As always, you can view photos of the past games nights in our gallery (editor’s note: now closed). You snooze, you lose!

This round we'll be showing the movie **Primer**. _"Four friends/fledgling entrepreneurs, knowing that there's something bigger and more innovative than the different error-checking devices they've built, wrestle over their new invention."_ We'll also have an xbox 360 and xbox for flashy gaming and 8-player support. But we won't be doing a computer LAN this round to make things simpler. Still, maybe some next generation gaming on the projectors in DEMP 110 will tickle you the right way. We have lots of pop & chips. Plus, we'll do a group pizza order as usual.

**UBC Tech Career Fair**

_When: Thursday Jan. 26, 10:00am-4:00pm \
Where: SUB Ballroom_

On Thursday, January 26th, 2006, we, along with our fine friends in UBC Engineering Physics and UBC IEEE, are putting on the **12th Annual UBC Tech Career Fair** with over 16 companies confirmed, and many more in waiting. Everybody, both past and present, and in any discipline is invited to come!

If you're graduating, you have no excuse not to come. Even if you're an undergrad, it's a great way to get a headstart, whether you're a co-op student, or looking for summer internships, or just want to know what's out there. Visit the SUB Ballroom, and meet representatives from local technology companies and firms, and use those networking skills and elevator speeches. Or come to the multitude of employer information sessions scheduled throughout the day to find out more about a specific company through a presentation.

Careerfair news will be posted as it arrives. Info session schedules will be posted in the next few weeks or so, as well as the floor plan at the [main page](https://cf06.thecube.ca/) for the career fair.

**IBM Extreme Blue Internship Program**

The Extreme Blue program is IBM's premier internship for top-notch students pursuing software development and MBA degrees. If you're chosen for the program, you become part of a team working in one of a dozen Extreme Blue labs around the world. Your team's challenge: develop the technology and business plan for a new product or service that addresses an existing market challenge. Through the program, interns have submitted more than 270 patent disclosures and contributed six projects to the open source community, two for alphaWorks, and helped create solutions for key clients and bring-to-market the next generation of IBM products. Not bad for just 12 weeks.

Unlike other intern programs that may relegate you to work on outdated technology, Extreme Blue teams work on leading technology that helps grow your skills and make you a more attractive candidate in the technology field. Interns in this high-performance environment get to roll up their sleeves and work with "hot" technology, like Linux, Grid computing, RFID, and Web services. **Applications are due on January 31st, 2006** - better apply fast!
