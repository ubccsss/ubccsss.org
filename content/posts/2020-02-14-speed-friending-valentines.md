#### WHAT

Are you looking for something to do on Valentine's day? Wanting to make friends in your major? How about someone to grab pok√© with or run to class together?
Come and join us at the CSSS Speed Friending (like speed dating, minus the awkward pick-up lines!).
The event will take place at 6pm on Feb 14th at ICICS 246! Come with friends or by yourself, and we guarantee that you will not walk out alone!
