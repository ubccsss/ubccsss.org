#### WHAT

Are you looking for something to do on Valentine's day? Wanting to make friends in your major? How about someone to grab poké with or run to class together? 
Come and join us at the CSSS Speed Friending (like speed dating, minus the awkward pick-up lines!). 
The event will take place at 6pm on Feb 14th at ICICS 246! Come with friends or by yourself, and we guarantee that you will not walk out alone!
