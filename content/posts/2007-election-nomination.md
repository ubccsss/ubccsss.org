![](/files/elections.jpeg)As you may (or may not) remember from previous years, the CSSS elections happen annually in April for the different positions. By becoming an executive, besides leading activities and projects for the society and department, you have a vote on every decision that is made in executive meetings - you literally shape the events that you and your fellow students take part in. You not only get a chance to improve your leadership and communication skills, but you will also make new friends and interact with some of faculty and staff members within the CS department.

If you're interested in getting involved with the Society, these are the positions we're taking nomination forms for:

- President
- Internal Vice President
- External Vice President
- Social Coordinator (2 positions)
- Grad Representative
- Treasurer
- Secretary

If you're interested, please [download the nomination form](/files/Elections%202007.pdf) and submit it to CSSS office or scan and send it to our Elections official ([\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#53363f3630273a3c3d2013273b36302631367d3032)) no later than **Thursday, March 29, at 5 pm.**
