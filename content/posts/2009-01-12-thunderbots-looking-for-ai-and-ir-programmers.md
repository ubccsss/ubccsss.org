The UBC Thunderbots have an opening for a senior AI lead. We also have room for both AI and IR team members.

The UBC Thunderbots is a student team dedicated in creating autonomous soccer playing robots to compete internationally at the Robocup competition and conference, held this year in Austria.

Taking on the position would give an opportunity to work with advanced AI and possibly IR. Our prototypes would be ready by January, there would be a chance to directly apply the programming to the robot. There is also a chance for a cheap (or possibly free) chance to go to Austria in the summer.

Our AI team currently is rather small and slightly inexperienced (compared to our over-large ElectroMech teams) and we are looking to recruit heavily this second term. Most likely we feel that we would get more younger students, so we're looking for someone with good leadership ability with some good understanding of AI to organize everybody second term.

The time commitment is varried on how well the person can delegate tasks and how good the person is with programming AI. There are meetings every Saturday, but there are options for the software teams (AI and IR) to meet on seperately.
