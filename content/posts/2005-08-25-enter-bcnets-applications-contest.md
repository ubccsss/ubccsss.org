BCNET is out to prove how innovative applications are being used over BCNET's advanced research networks. If you have created a really unique online application that is making a difference, then enter BCNET's **Coolest Applications Contest**. Use whatever you know about PHP, ASP .NET and other online technologies to earn cash prizes and fame (in BC anyways)! :-)

You must apply by October 31st and provide a working version by January 30th, 2006. More details can be found on the [contest poster](http://www.bc.net/news_events_publications/bcnet_poster.pdf).
