There are still some seats available in the tri-mentoring program, especially for first and second year computer science students. Joining the program will provide you with the chance to meet a senior student and an industry/faculty mentor, fine tune your communication and networking skills, get advice on your courses and career paths, and socialize with other mentors and mentees. If you missed the tri-mentoring orientation yesterday, there is another tri-mentoring orientation that you can go to on September 27 at 5:30 pm in Hennings 200. Please sign up by emailing [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c9a4a7ae89aabae7bcabaae7aaa8).
