HiretheWorld is a Vancouver based business that connects employers with computing students for short term projects. The budget and scope of these projects are variable but it’s easy to browse through and find the project that suits you.

Here are some examples:

- [JQuery Fullscreen Accordion](https://hiretheworld.com/freelance/jobs/2853/) (flexible budget)
- [PHP/mySQL fix](https://hiretheworld.com/freelance/jobs/2697/) ($85)
- [Wordpress Theme Upload Help](https://hiretheworld.com/freelance/jobs/2728/) ($30)

If you’re looking for some interesting/challenging projects or looking to boost the bank account, our site might be a good fit. It’s completely free to join, apply and to discuss the projects with employers. To help us advertise to bring in more employers for you, we do retain a percentage of the payment you receive (never more than 10%) which is indicated very clearly when you are applying.
