Discover CPSC at the U of C is a two-day workshop for students interested in a graduate degree in Computer Science to see and experience our department’s world-class facilities first-hand.

You will get a chance to meet with our faculty, graduate students, and actually see the department labs and facilities. You will hear about what graduate school is, the kind of research you can do at U of C, what our funding models are, and from our graduate students about what grad school is like. Most importantly, you’ll get a chance to experience some of the best that Calgary has to offer!

!! COOL, SO WHAT HAPPENS?

Thursday, we will fly you out here. You will stay at Hotel Alma, our award-winning university hotel. Friday, you spend the day with us at the Department, checking out the cool research. Saturday, you hang out with the graduate students doing a cool activity like checking out Banff or Canada Olympic Park. Then, we fly you home.
