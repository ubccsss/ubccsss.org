How to Prepare for a Career Fair

When employers descend upon campus looking to hire UBC students, will you be ready? UBC's Career Education team joins forces with superhero Chris Irveses to bring you a workshop that will get you trained, prepped, and ready in time for two upcoming career fairs.

Through an interactive workshop, we'll provide you with the effective skills, strategies, and superpowers you'll need to win over any potential employer. This session is open to all UBC students and alumni from all faculties. \
