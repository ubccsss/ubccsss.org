The [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences](http://www.pims.math.ca/) is having their first **Math Mania** event at Science World and they need your help. Please join them on Oct 27 and Oct 28 from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. They need volunteers for this weekend event, and you can join for one day or both days of the event.

It is a lot of fun using methods to teach math and computer science concepts to children (and adults!) by games and art. Lots of hands-on activities!

*   Exciting Geometrical Models from Straws and Paper
*   Mathematical Puzzles
*   The Guessing Game
*   A Sorting Network
*   The Penny Game
*   The Set Game
*   Bubbles
*   and more!

If you can volunteer for either of these days or both please send Melania Alvarez [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#771a121b16191e1637071e1a04591a16031f591416) an e-mail.
