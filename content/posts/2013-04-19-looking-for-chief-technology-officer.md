Are you an iOS developer interested in education and making a difference in the world? Sounds cheesy, but we promise it’s not. Professor Holger Hoos and I are working with the Education Faculty at UBC to create an iPad app that helps advisors better evaluate teachers.

We are interviewing junior developers and candidates for our Chief Technology Officer position at the company. Early on the pay will be equity in the company, but as soon as we finish the product (in August) all developers will be paid and will have the option of holding their equity or selling it for cash.

Please send me an email at <`mthomas[dot]denver[at]gmail[dot]com`\> if you are interested in helping start what we truly believe will be a multi-million dollar company that can change the world.
