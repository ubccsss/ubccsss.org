<a name="2"></a><strong>Henry Kautz: Understanding Human Behaviour from Sensor Data</strong></p>
<p><em>When: Thursday Mar. 16, 4:00-5:30pm<br>
Where: Dempster Pavilion, Room 310</em></p>
<p>The convergence of advances in algorithms for probabilistic reasoning and the development of low-cost, easily-deployed sensors is reviving the dream of AI to develop systems that can understand the narrative of ordinary human life. On the reasoning side, the AI community is developing techniques that bridge the gap between propositional Bayesian representations and hierarchical models of goals, plans, and actions. On the sensing side, new technologies such as RFID tags, GPS, motes, and wearable multi-modal sensors allow us to gather direct information about many aspects of human experience. I will describe recent work with my students and colleagues on developing systems that learn patterns of human activity for everyday tasks, both indoors and outdoors, using a variety of dynamic probabilistic models. I will then describe applications of these techniques to healthcare systems as part of the Assisted Cognition Project, a joint effort between our departments of computer science and rehabilitation medicine.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.terry.ubc.ca&lt;/a&gt;Terry (www.terry.ubc.ca)&lt;/a&gt; is a joint TLEF initiative of the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Science, with support from the Michael Smith Laboratories, VP Students, UBC Campus Sustainability Office, UBC Okanagan, UBC Bookstore, UBC Let&apos;s Talk Science Partnership Program, and the Chan Centre for Performing Arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UBC Bookstore and Terry are pleased to announce a writing challenge, and a grand one at that. There will be three sets of prizes available, which involve the hunt for pieces in the following categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, please read on...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first category seeks creative pieces that perhaps work best to subtlety elicit awareness of the myriad of global issues presented in this website. These pieces could take the form (but are not limited to) poetry, fiction, literary humour, visual, audio, and/or personal essay. Limited to those from the UBC community (students, staff and/or faculty).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second category seeks out non-fiction pieces that can take the form of academic essay, review/textbook article, commentary, and/or critical analysis. More importantly, these pieces should discuss some aspect of the general themes that our speakers represent, in an attempt to help formulate (whether by describing methodology or simply by education) proactive responses. Limited to those from the UBC community (students, staff and/or faculty).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The third category is open to all. The first two categories are limited to those from the UBC community (students, staff and/or faculty). This simply entails submissions culled from the general public that would fit in either category, perhaps even both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pieces should be no longer than 2000 words , and can happily be something you have to write anyway for your courses. The deadline for submissions is &lt;strong&gt;March 31st, 2006&lt;/strong&gt;. Previously published material (where permission is obtained) is just fine although may be considered less competitive than original works. Please inquire with specifics regarding audio or visual pieces. Note that the author retains full copyright of any work published on our site, although we would love to be credited with showing it off.
