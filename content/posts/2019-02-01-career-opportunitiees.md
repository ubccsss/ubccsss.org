### UBC Culture and Self Lab - Develop a computer game

The UBC Culture and Self Lab is looking for students, specifically with
experience in Computer Science to assist with a study involving attention and
memory. The ideal research assistant will be asked to create a multi-player,
2-dimensional virtual board game for use in the study. The game is a simplified
interpretation of an old board game called ‘Game of Life’ where people make
educational, employment and family decisions which determine their ‘success’ at
the end. Data captured from participant decisions during the game play will be
collated and analysed toward the research findings.

The RA may get involved in the entire research process, from design to analysis.
The project will be under the direction of the Principal Investigator, Dr.
Steven Heine and his graduate student, Anita Schmalor. Letters of reference will
be provided if needed.

To apply, please forward your unofficial transcript and CV to the lab manager,
Vanessa - [mecclabs@psych.ubc.ca](mailto:mecclabs@psych.ubc.ca)
