After Google, IBM, and EA, who have we left out? **Microsoft**, of course!

![](/files/microsoft.gif)On Wednesday Nov. 23, 2005 from 6:00-7:15pm, [MSFT](http://www.investor.reuters.com/FullQuote.aspx?ticker=MSFT) will be visiting UBC. Whether you use Microsoft products or not is irrelevant - the fact is that they are the _largest software company_ in the world. And they are always hiring!

Hear speakers talk about the software and projects Microsoft works on (it isn't just Vista) and what it's like to work there. **UBC alumni** (including last year's CSSS president Jono Luk) will be there to relate their experiences there. **Don't forget to bring your resume!** They want to hire you! That's why they're coming! And as always, it comes with pizza!

See [Microsoft College Careers](https://www.microsoft.com/College/default.mspx) for more information about working at Microsoft. Or, check out [theSpoke](http://thespoke.net) for general talk and more information about the **Imagine Cup** in New Delhi this year!

When: 

Wednesday, November 23, 2005 - 17:00 to 18:15
