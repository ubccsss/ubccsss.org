<p>Sokanu is a social learning platform aimed at helping people find their passion in<br>
life. We believe that people have talents and are passionate about many things, but often<br>
don&#x2019;t know how to translate that passion into a career they love. Sokanu will combine a<br>
social networking platform with an adaptive learning engine to provide a unique<br>
experience to each user.</p>
<h3>What We&apos;re Looking For</h3>
<p>We are seeking a versatile and experienced software engineer to finish our alpha product<br>
with code that is clean, functional, and easy to maintain. You&apos;ll be extending Sokanu&#x2019;s<br>
content platforms in new directions, as well as streamlining and re-factoring our existing<br>
systems. We plan on growing by leaps and bounds, so candidates should thrive in<br>
dynamic environments where development is fast and the only constant is change. You<br>
should also believe in open platforms and want the development community at large to<br>
build off your successes via open standards and API&#x2019;s.</p>
<h3>You should have in-depth knowledge of</h3>
<ul>
<li>CMS best practices</li>
<li>The in&#x2019;s and out&#x2019;s of popular open source CMS and blog platforms</li>
<li>Collecting community-crafted content and how to integrate it with internal CMS workflows</li>
<li>Video platforms such as YouTube, Blip.tv, and others</li>
<li>Mass distribution email systems</li>
<li>Preferable knowledge in .NET, C# and SQL</li>
<li>Database scaling at the application level and caching approaches, from object caching to CDNs</li>
<li>RESTful web services APIs for developers, both building &amp; using them</li>
<li>Performance tuning web applications from the frontend to the backend</li>
<li>Scale and what it takes to be successful at a community-driven web site where the word &#x201C;millions&#x201D; is used frequently and in many contexts</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bonus experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript and associated frameworks (jQuery, prototype, YUI)</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence knowledge, experience with Self-Organizing Maps/Kohonen Networks, Neural Networks, Adaptive Decision-Engines, etc.&#x2026;</li>
<li>Social networking applications and associated design patterns</li>
<li>Abuse and anti-spam approaches and technologies</li>
<li>Ideally, you hold a B.S. or M.S in Computer Science, or have equivalent self-directed study and experience.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Also important</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shipping: you can point to products on the web today that you built and shipped</li>
<li>Love of the web and a sense of fascination with the endless possibilities it creates</li>
<li>Love creating products that are extremely easy to use and applying psychology to UX/UI</li>
<li>A sense of humour</li>
<li>Excellent communication skills</li>
</ul>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>If you&#x2019;re interested in joining the team at Sokanu, please send a cover letter along with<br>
your r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#402a2f223300332f2b212e356e232f2d"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1973767b6a596a767278776c377a7674">[email&#xA0;protected]</span></a> telling us what inspires you about Sokanu and why you think you are a perfect fit.
