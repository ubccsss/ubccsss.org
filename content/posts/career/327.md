<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Career Services Interview Skills Workshop on Nov. 30th! It is the last Workshop for the term and we have a few spots remaining. One of the Employers who will be participating is Electronic Arts so it would be a great opportunity for students who may be potentially targeting EA as an Employer, to attend and meet face-to-face with one of their HR Recruiting Staff. Students also get a chance to practice their Interview Skills with the Employers. </p>
<p>Registration is mandatory: <a href="http://www.careers.ubc.ca">www.careers.ubc.ca</a>; click on workshop sign-up<br>
