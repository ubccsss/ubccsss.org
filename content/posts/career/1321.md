<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>On March 3, 2010 student entrepreneurs from across the city will be meeting to fuse their awesome business ideas with equally awesome talent! </p>
<p>Throw in some sushi, drinks &amp; a quick chat from experienced entrepreneur, UCLA Alumni &amp; founder of Silicon Valley startup <a href="http://viralogy.com/">Viralogy.com</a> Yukai Chou, and welcome to the Vancouver&apos;s First &quot;Young Co-Founders Wanted&quot; Speed-dating session.</p>
<p>Unlike other networking events for entrepreneurs, the Young Co-Founders Wanted (YCW) Meetup group is focused on the needs of student or young entrepreneurs interested in running startup companies. Whether at the ideas or early-stage, YCF is aimed at being an extremely simple but effective way for student entrepreneurs across the city to meet.</p>
<p><a href="https://meetup.com/Vancouver-Young-Co-Founders-Wanted">Tickets</a> are $5 (9 spots left as of Friday, February 26); ticket price includes sushi appetizers &amp; cover. The first 10 students will be entered to win a prize package of &quot;2 Hours Workspace Time&quot; from the Network Hub.</p>
<p>This Event Is For:</p>
<ul>
<li>Student entrepreneurs looking for startup talent</li>
<li>Students interested in working on a startup</li>
<li>Early-stage companies looking for talented student</li>
</ul>
<p>Why YCW?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because many students and young entrepreneurs have ideas but don&apos;t know how to implement them.</li>
<li>Because crazy coders, ruby ninjas, and amazing designers exist and want good ideas to work on.</li>
<li>Because there is no structured forum to connect young people who really want to start companies.</li>
<li>Because there is no easy way for early-stage startups to find student interns or talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to <a href="https://meetup.com/Vancouver-Young-Co-Founders-Wanted">register</a> now as tickets will start going fast!</p>
