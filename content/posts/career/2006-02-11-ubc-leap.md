According to their website, <em>LEAP: An innovative collaboration between students, faculty and administration developed to strategically coordinate the use of resources to better meet the learning and research needs of UBC students.</em>  This is a fantastic resource site, launched by UBC and the AMS and looks to have amazing potential.  The website includes many resources including a link to some upcoming workshops on study and research skills that are offered free to students and information about the completely new AMS online tutoring initiative.  Sounds like a win-win scenario to me!</p>
