Calling for all ENERGETIC, and ENTHUSIASTIC volunteers for Imagine UBC!

If you are interested in joining the UBC Orientations Team as a:

- MUG Leader, Squad Manager or Welcome Team Member with IMAGINE UBC
- Group Leader or Welcome Leader with GALA - INTERNATIONAL ORIENTATION
- Group Leader with PARENT, TRANSFER STUDENT or MATURE STUDENT ORIENTATION

…then please apply at [https://secure.students.ubc.ca/orientations/apply.cfm](https://secure.students.ubc.ca/orientations/apply.cfm) before February 4th!

Since first years are allowed to select CPSC as their major once they apply to UBC, there are MUG groups that's dedicated to first year CPSC students! Therefore, it's important for us to show the first year students what we've got!

The earlier you apply, the better the choice of timeslots you will have for your Group Interview with senior leaders on our team. Group Interviews will take place February 5th–11th. Please note that both new and returning applicants will be required to attend group interviews. Applicants must be returning as registered UBC students in September of 2009 to be eligible for positions with UBC Orientations. If you have any questions about being a leader, please email [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b7dedad6d0ded9d299ded9d1d8f7c2d5d499d4d6).

Keep in mind that UBC Orientations has replaced the first day of school for ALL UBC students next year, not just first year students (with some exceptions). So student volunteers need not worry about missing the first day of classes.
