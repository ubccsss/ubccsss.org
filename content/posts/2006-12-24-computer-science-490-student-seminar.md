Are you interested in algorithms, but find the theory
a bit dry? Do you want a chance to actually implement
the algorithms instead of just learning about them? Try
**CPSC 490**! This student directed seminar -- coordinated
by 2 members of the ACM programming team -- will give
you a chance to learn the fundamental algorithms, and
then apply them to actual programming problems (if you
are thinking of interviewing with Microsoft or Google,
this is exactly the kind of thing you want to be able to do).

The class counts as a regular 400-level CPSC course. A time has not
yet been chosen for the course: once students have registered, a time
will be selected that fits everyone's schedule. **CPSC 320 is a
pre-requisite** for this course.

If you would like more information before deciding, you can check out
last year's website or click on "read more" below: [http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/](http://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs490/).

If you have questions about CPSC 490, email the student coordinators.
To apply for registration into the course, please send an email to
[\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) by Wednesday, January 4th at noon. At most 15
students can register for the course. Students will either be registered
in the course by the end of Friday, January 6th, or will be sent email
explaining why they could not be registered.
