If you're interested in having a chance to meet and network with CS experts from **Microsoft, IBM, Apple, EA, and Business Objects**, then you should come join us in volunteering for the 2007/08 Tri-mentoring Kick-off event.

Currently we are looking for volunteers for the following shifts:

Shift A: 4:00 - 5:00pm - set up and signage \
Shift B: 5:00 - 6:30pm - ushering, registration, greeting \
Shift C: 7:00 - 8:00pm - clean-up \
If you can stay for more than one shift, that would be great!

Please send James[

### [**jlo**@thecube.ca](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5cfc9cae5d1cdc0c6d0c7c08bc6c4)

an email by Thursday Sept 27 if you're interested. Also tell us which shifts you would like to sign up for (e.g. A & B, just A, whatever). We'll send a reminder to volunteers participating in the event.

Hope to see you out there! If you have any questions, email James ([jlo_at_thecube_dot_ca](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a6cccac9e6d2cec3c5d3c4c388c5c7)) or Eugene ([echan0_at_interchange_dot_ubc_dot_ca](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a6a0aba2adf383aaadb7a6b1a0aba2ada4a6edb6a1a0eda0a2)).
