<dt>President: Thomas Lamb</dt>
<dd>Hi. My name is Tom Lamb. I have spent time with various clubs at UBC, such as the Math Club, and the Arts Undergraduate Society, and now the Computer Science Student Society. I have been with the CSSS for two years&#x2014;first as Social Coordinator, then as VP Social&#x2014;and am now running for President. In recent years, the club has seen consistent improvement. If elected president, I would like to continue that success by focusing on our sense of identity and camaraderie as computer science students, while maintaining the services the club currently offers. This would mean the creation of social events which appeal to a broader range of interests, as well as more marketing to increase awareness of the club and its services.</dd>
<dt>VP External: Michael Kwan</dt>
<dd>Hello everyone! My name is Michael Kwan and I&#x2019;m running to serve as your Vice-President External of the Computer Science Student Society which is the position in charge of the annual technical career fair.

I hope to create another successful career fair for you all in the upcoming year so please vote for me as your upcoming VP External. Your vote is highly appreciated!</dd>

<strong>I invest more time in keeping the Cube clean bar none.</strong></li>

</dd>
<dt>VP Social: Clara Chu</dt>
<dd>The most memorable experiences I have had at UBC are undeniably the times where I&#x2019;ve been able to meet some of my closest friends today.<br>
As a first year BUCS student, I am ecstatic to be running for the position of VP Social. I hope to provide Computer Science students the opportunity to connect with their peers in a welcoming and comfortable social setting where common interests are discovered and shared. One of my main goals is to engage as many students as possible, touching on every type of social activity from sports to partying to food! When one activity doesn&#x2019;t correlate with your interests, I&#x2019;m hoping that at least several others will.<br>
As VP Social, it will be in my best interests for everyone to gain the most out of their university experience, providing an abundance of options for you to create unforgettable and lasting memories.</dd>

<dt>VP Administration: Jinny Byun</dt>
<dd>Hi! My name is Jinny Byun and I&#x2019;m currently in first year Computer Science. I started hanging out in the Cube during the fall and I&apos;ve always felt welcome here. The Cube made my first year at UBC much better as I was able to make many new friends. I hope to get involved in the CSSS by becoming VP Administration and give back to the fantastic students that make up the CSSS. This position is well suited to me as I&#x2019;m very organized, hard-working, and have great time management. I put a lot of effort into the things I do! I plan to keep the CSSS running smoothly and be awesome for the future (and present!) students.<br>
Vote for Jinny! I won&#x2019;t let you down!</dd>
<dt>VP Administration: Vincent (Yi Xi) Wang</dt>
<dd>I am currently a second year student specializing in business and computer science with interest in business intelligence and app development. As an ambitious, persistent and team-oriented individual, I strive to challenge the limits of my potential through academic and extracurricular involvement. In the past, I have been involved with several organizing committees including Sauder Summit, Chinese Collegiate Society, Scouts Canada and BNS Grad Council. Through these experiences, I have developed extensive problem-solving, communication, organizational and leadership skills which will benefit CSSS indefinitely. As VP Administration, I plan on initiating several projects throughout the year focusing on student engagement and developing a coherent atmosphere within the computer science faculty. With this goal in mind, I will actively create opportunities for students to network with industry professionals, alumni&#x2019;s and with other students from different years. Ultimately, this summary highlights why I am a successful candidate and your future VP Administration. Cheers!</dd>
