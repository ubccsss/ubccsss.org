More about our panelists:

**Marija Radulovic-Nastic**: Director - Creative Services, EAC \

Prior to her role in Creative Services, Marija was responsible for EA WW technology development in North America. Some of the projects Marija and her team worked on were the rendering engine, animation tools and systems, as well as other core tech components used in almost every EA game.

Before joining the exciting and challenging video game industry, Marija spent 10 years in business software development where she held various positions, from software engineering and technical sales to director of program management.

During this time she received several awards for outstanding professional achievements. Marija has an MSc in Electrical Engineering and a BSc in Computer Science from Belgrade University. In her free time, Marija enjoys adventure travel, skiing, cycling with her husband, and savoring gourmet food and fine wines.

Liza is the Development Director for a Common Technology team in Creative Services at Electronic Arts Canada. Liza's team of exceptionally talented software developers build the tools and technologies to create, deliver and integrate the art in the EA SportsT games produced in Burnaby.

Liza started her career as a Manufacturing Quality Engineer for high-end Cisco router assemblies at Celestica, Inc. in Toronto. In 1999, the high-tech boom and warmer weather drew Liza to a Test Engineering position with Cisco Systems in San Jose, California. In late 2001, she joined the New Product Program Management team for CRS-1, the world's fastest router (according to the folks at Guinness). Always a Canadian at heart, Liza moved to Burnaby, BC to join Kensington Computer Products Group as a Program Manager for micro fuel cell development and other consumer power products.

Liza has a Bachelor of Science (Engineering Chemistry) from Queen's University and a certificate of Electrical Engineering from Santa Clara University. In her spare time, she is a virtual member of the Write On! writer's group she formed in California. She published two stories in the self-published Write On! literary anthology in late 2005.
