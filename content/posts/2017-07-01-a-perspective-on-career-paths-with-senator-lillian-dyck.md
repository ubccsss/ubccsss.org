**A Perspective on Career Paths with Senator Lillian Dyck**

A member of the Gordon First Nations in Saskatchewan, Dr. Lillian Eva Dyck is well-known as an advocate for women and Aboriginals, and is a leading figure and role model in Canadaâ€™s scientific community. At the Keynote, Senator Dyck will talk about her family background and education. Feminism and Cree beliefs have proved to be of great help in providing her with insights and the strength to overcome various obstacles in her career as a scientist and professor. She will compare Western science, feminist science and Aboriginal science, and how the Medicine Wheel of the Plains Indians can be used to analyze science and show where it can be improved to attract and retain women and Aboriginals.

Admission is **free**, and the event is open to the public. Please RSVP to:
