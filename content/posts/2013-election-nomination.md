CSSS elections are coming up, so vote on March 14th/15th from 11AM-3PM at \
Reboot café.

Interested in an executive position in the Cube for 2013-2014? Get your nominations together! This is a great opportunity to show leadership, challenge yourself, and have fun! For your name to go on the ballot, you will need nominations from ten members of the CSSS (all students in the Computer Science department are members). Members of the CSSS are all undergraduate students in the Computer Science department (the grad students are part of the CSGSA). We have a database of student numbers, and will be checking against it, which is why you have extra spaces available. If in doubt, get more students to sign your nomination form!

Nominations can be picked up at the Cube Office (ICICS 021). Forms must be submitted at the Cube Office by 12PM on Wednesday, March 13th to be approved by the CSSS Returning Officer, Kerry Li <elections \[at\] thecube \[dot\] ca>. Submit your forms as early as possible, because voting starts the next day! The earlier your form is approved, the earlier you can start campaigning!

The positions open are:

- President
