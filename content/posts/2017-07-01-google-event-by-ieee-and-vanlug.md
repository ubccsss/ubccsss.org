The [Vancouver Linux User Group](http://www.vanlug.bc.ca/) and the [IEEE Communications Society UBC Chapter](http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~ieee/) are pleased to be hosting two presentations by Google on Monday February 20th. We would like to take this opportunity to invite yourself, your members, and other interested students to attend what we believe will be very interesting presentations.

There will be two presentations: the first will take place at UBC in [Kaiser Room 2030](http://www.maps.ubc.ca/PROD/index_detail.php?show=y,n,n,n,n,y&bldg2Search=n&locat1=313) from 4:00 to 5:30 pm and the second will take place at BCIT in the TELUS Theatre from 7:30 to 9:00 pm.

The presentations are being given by **Brian Edmonds** who is a long-time VanLUG member who currently works for Google as a Site Reliability Engineer. He will be discussing the technical aspects of what his job entails as well as what working at Google is like in general. He will also discuss how to make the best use of the Google API. Google will have recruiters on hand to meet with people who are interested in learning more about working at Google.

Both events will include pizza and pop refreshments.

When: 

Monday, February 20, 2006 - 15:00 to 16:30

Where:
