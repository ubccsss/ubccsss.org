[OpenRoad](http://openroad.ca/) is currently collaborating with the BC Liquor Distribution Board to bring you the new BC Liquor Store Android app, and we need your help!

Participants must have been to a BC Liquor Store in the past 30 days and be an android user (preferably a regular user of mobile apps).

During the session, participants will be asked to complete a set of tasks on the app and then asked some follow up questions. These are facilitated sessions that will be observed and video taped (for design use only). The session will be on Thursday, Sept 13, 2012 in Vancouver Downtown and will be 1 hour long. Your time is much appreciated and will be compensated $50.

If you are interested, please contact [Jennifer Weng <\[email protected\]\>](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#7d170a18131a3d120d18130f121c19531e1c) with answers to the following questions:

- Have you visited a BC Liquor Store (not cold beer and wine, or private store) in the past 30 days?
- How often do you visit a BC Liquor Store? (not including other alcohol shops)
- Which type of alcohol do you typically purchase? Wine, Beer, or Spirits (hard liquor)
- What model of Android phone do you have? What version of Android are you using?
- What is your availability for Thursday, September 13th?

If there are any questions or concerns at all, please contact [Jennifer Weng <\[email protected\]\>](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4e24392b20290e213e2b203c212f2a602d2f).
