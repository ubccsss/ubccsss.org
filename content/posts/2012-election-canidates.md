VP External: Akshat Divrkar

My name is AKSHAT DIVEKAR and I am a second year CS student running for the position of VP External for the upcoming year. About me, I have strong team working and networking skills, with an ability to lead and work collaboratively. I have also participated in some CSSS initiatives in the past, such as sites of change and simply appreciate the events that the CSSS organizes for us, from monthly barbeques to the career fair and the tech talks. Talking about my experience, I have held executive positions at various clubs in the past and am currently a Webmaster at another club, a tutor for SOS while also being a teaching assistant for CPSC 210. Apart from that, I am always interested in learning about and trying out new things, whatever they may be. I love watching movies and documentaries, designing websites and listening to music (currently learning drums!).
