Are you a Co-op student going on a workterm this January? If so then you are invited to an informal question and answer period with former Microsoft interns from UBC.

Love Microsoft? Hate Microsoft? Want to know more about Microsoft? Come either way and find out from people who have been there and done it everything you want to know about Microsoft. We can tell you about the different job roles at Microsoft (Program Manager / Software Development Engineer / Software Development Engineer in Test), what the interview process will be like, help you with resume tips, and our own personal experience as interns at Microsoft. Ask us anything and we will do our best to answer.

Where: room X139 (in the new CS building) \
When: Friday Sept 16th, 2005 11:30 am

Hope to see you all there!

Peter Andes \
(former) Microsoft Intern

NOTE: For those of you not in co-op or not planning on going on a workterm this january we are planning a very similar but MUCH bigger event for January and EVERYONE is invited so watch out for that!

When:

Friday, September 16, 2005 - 11:30 to 12:30

Where:

ICICS/CS X139
