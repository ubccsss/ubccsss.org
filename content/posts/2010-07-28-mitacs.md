[MITACS Inc.](http://mitacs.ca/) is looking for embeddable, interactive programs that include interesting math content that appeals to high school students. All material will be appropriately credited to its creator and, to recognize the best student contributions to Year of Science, MITACS will offer a number of honorariums and other prizes for the best submissions. The timeline for this project is quite shortâ€”submissions must be received by Friday, August 27th to be guaranteed consideration.

If interested, please contact MITACS Outreach Assistant [Kamara Gupta](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bed5d9cbcecadffed3d7cadfddcd90dddf).
