Working from a clearly-defined list of issues which we provide, the successful candidate will analyze existing PHP-based reports and functions to determine the source of documented errors. He/she will report on the cause of the error and recommend necessary changes to the code.

Excellent communication skills and concision are required as the supervisor's time is extremely limited. In-depth knowledge of PHP and the SQL database query language are necessities. The pages to be debugged are part of an extensive web-based intranet site, written in PHP with a MySQL database back-end. The code in question powers web-based parameterized reports. $20.00/hour.

Please login with your U-Connect account for more information or simply create one at [www.u-connect.ca](http://u-connect.ca/) to apply to this project.
