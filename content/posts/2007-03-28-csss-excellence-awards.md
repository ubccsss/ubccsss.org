Do you know anyone in Computer Science that deserves recognition for their
involvement in the computer science community at UBC?
We are offering **three $500 awards** this year for anyone who has
demonstrated a strong involvement to the computer science
community at UBC.

#### How to apply?

Submit your resume and two supporting letters (one from a fellow student
and one from a faculty member) to the Computer Science office front desk
(ICICS buildng) **before April 12th!**

The awards will then be distributed at the grad reception after being
adjudicated by UAC.
