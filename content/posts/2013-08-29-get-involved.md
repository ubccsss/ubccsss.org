Getting involved in the Cube is one of the best ways to become a part of the UBC Computer Science community. Getting involved helps you to make friends, meet professors and have an all-round awesome experience. If you are interested, check out the open positions that we have available in our <a href="/club/about/volunteer">Volunteering Committee</a> then e-mail Andr&#xE9; Malan at <code>&lt;vpv[at]thecube.ca&gt;</code> with the position that you want.
