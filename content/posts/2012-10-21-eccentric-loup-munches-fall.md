One of the best kept secrets in the CS department is the weekly **Eccentric Loup Munches**. There, young (and old) minds ponder the great questions and issues surrounding computing science and offer great insight over lunch and a snack.

Organized by **Steve Wolfman**, this event has lasted through the summer and is now scheduled to continue onwards through the fall. As this is a weekly thing, we won't list all the topics that will be covered, however, you can check out their official website and scour the newsgroups (ubc.cs.undergrad (editor’s note: now closed)) for more information.

The latest post as of this writing is here (editor’s note: now closed). So stay up to date and come out! It would be a shame if someone solved the [P vs NP Problem](https://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/) at a weekly munch and you weren't there to witness it! :p
