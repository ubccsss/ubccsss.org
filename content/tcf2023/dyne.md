  DYNE is a revolutionary SaaS company that allows restaurants to scale and boost their revenue.<br/><br/>
  Over the course of the pandemic, almost everyone in some form fought the silent battle of loneliness, with 81% of students left feeling isolated and alone and over 70% of the restaurants lost their customers and filed for bankruptcy. This needed to be changed and thus DYNE was born. We provide our state-of-the-art analytics dashboard (with ML) to our B2B clients (restaurants) which help them build on their customers' sentiment analysis, provide pricing strategies and even targeted marketing to increase their brand presence. On an average our clients have seen 9-11x revenue growth within 3 months of service.<br/><br/>
  On the B2C side, we target people through our interactive social mobile app. We provide exclusive discounts, personalised restaurant recommendations and allow friends and like minded peers with mutual interests to meet through our map features with gamified quests that helps them plan the best hangout in just 5 clicks!<br/><br/>
  With everything we do, we love to unite people over the love of food. Interested to know more? Come DYNE with us :)
