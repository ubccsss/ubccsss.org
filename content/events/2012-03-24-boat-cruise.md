It’s that time of the year again: the time when we all need a break, a dinner out, a {nice|rainy} view of the city, music by DJs Autonomy and DJBee, maybe some dancing, and a chance to sing “I’m On a Boat” far too many times. Tickets for our year-end cruise are for sale now in the CSSS office, ICICS X139 until March 17 and ICICS 021 (at the end of the hallway by the undergraduate labs) after that.

CSSS members (all Computer Science undergraduate students) get tickets for $35 each for themselves and one guest. Others may buy tickets at $80 each. Boarding starts at 6:30 on the MV Harbour Princess; be sure to arrive before 7 unless you’re a strong swimmer.

When:

Saturday, March 24, 2012 - 19:00 to 23:00

Where:

Harbour Cruises, 501 Denman St.
