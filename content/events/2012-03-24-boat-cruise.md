<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>It&#x2019;s that time of the year again: the time when we all need a break, a dinner out, a {nice|rainy} view of the city, music by DJs Autonomy and DJBee, maybe some dancing, and a chance to sing &#x201C;I&#x2019;m On a Boat&#x201D; far too many times. Tickets for our year-end cruise are for sale now in the CSSS office, ICICS X139 until March 17 and ICICS 021 (at the end of the hallway by the undergraduate labs) after that.</p>
<p>CSSS members (all Computer Science undergraduate students) get tickets for $35 each for themselves and one guest. Others may buy tickets at $80 each. Boarding starts at 6:30 on the MV Harbour Princess; be sure to arrive before 7 unless you&#x2019;re a strong swimmer.</p>
