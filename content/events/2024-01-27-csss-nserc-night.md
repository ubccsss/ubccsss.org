The CS Department supports a number of research award opportunities each year. Students can apply to spend a term working full-time with funding in a research lab, building research experience and contributing to impactful, real-world projects. This kind of research experience is highly sought after by graduate programs and companies in the industry.

Join Professor Will Evans, the undergrad research award adjudication committee chair, Professor Caroline Lemieux, Professor Robert Xiao, Professor Arpan Gujarati, and former NSERC students to learn more about what makes an application stand out, how to get in touch with professors, and how research can make a difference in your career!
