Welcome to the 2017 Technical Career Fair. Traditionally held in January at the UBC campus, the fair offers you an opportunity to meet our students, survey their potential as future employees, and alert them to job and career opportunities in your company.

Last year, over 50 companies attended the Tech Career Fair to meet undergraduate and graduate students from a wide range of disciplines, including Computer Science, Cognitive Systems, Engineering Physics, and Electrical and Computer Engineering. This is a wonderful way for students to showcase their portfolio, and network with a wide range of companies to find out about internships and post-graduate career opportunities.

The 2017 Technical Career Fair will be held on Thursday, January 26th, 2017 from 10AM to 4PM in the West Atrium of the Life Sciences Centre. Hope to see you there!
