Last year, over 50 companies attended the Tech Career Fair to meet undergraduate and graduate students from a wide range of disciplines, including Computer Science, Cognitive Systems, Engineering Physics and Electrical & Computer Engineering.

This year CSSS and partnered clubs have been working hard to serve the growing interests of both the industry and student body, the Tech Career Fair has expanded to TWO DAYS with over 70 companies and 200+ industry professionals in attendance. This is the largest Technical Career Fair in UBC history.
