[![](/files/cfbannersmall.jpg)](//cf06.ubccsss.org/) On Thursday, January 26th, 2006, we, along with our fine friends in UBC Engineering Physics and UBC IEEE, are putting on the **12th Annual UBC Tech Career Fair** with 18 companies confirmed, and many more in waiting. Everybody, both past and present, and in any discipline is invited to come!

If you're graduating, you have no excuse not to come. Even if you're an undergrad, it's a great way to get a headstart, whether you're a co-op student, or looking for summer internships, or just want to know what's out there. Visit the SUB Ballroom, and meet representatives from local technology companies and firms, and use those networking skills and [elevator speeches](http://www.creativekeys.net/PowerfulPresentations/article1024.html). Or come to the multitude of employer information sessions scheduled throughout the day to find out more about a specific company through a presentation.

Careerfair news will be posted as it arrives. Info session schedules will be posted in the next few weeks or so, as well as the floor plan at the [main page for the career fair](//cf06.ubccsss.org/).

When: 

Thursday, January 26, 2006 - 09:00 to 15:00

Where:
