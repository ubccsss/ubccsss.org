Due to mounting concerns around the COVID-19 pandemic, we have decided that we cannot hold the CSSS Year-End Gala on April 9th, 2020 as planned. From your feedback and after much deliberation, we are postponing the Year-End Gala tentatively until graduation date (around May 25th). This is two months from the current date, and we are hopeful that the landscape may change enough so that we can hold the event in good conscience. We recognize that this is a sad and frustrating situation for many of you, especially those of you who are graduating this year and dearly wished to celebrate a sendoff amongst friends and loved ones found during your time here. Rest assured, we are equally devastated that we cannot celebrate with you all this April.

However, we value your health and safety above all, and we recognize that proceeding with the original plan would be irresponsible and dangerously dismissive of the reality that we must all seriously take precautions to alleviate the spread of the virus. For the good of the community, we urge you to stay home, adopt regular habits of hand-washing, and practice social distancing.

**_ TICKET LOGISTICS _**

Those who currently have tickets and are still interested in potentially attending the gala at a future date is encouraged to hold on to the ticket until that date, as with each purchase the CSSS is absorbing the process fees. However, if you are uncomfortable with that or you can not attend the gala at a different date, as always YOU MAY RECEIVE A FULL REFUND ANYTIME, regardless if the event is cancelled, postponed, or ongoing. As for those that have purchased group tickets with some members no longer attending and some members intending to hold on to their tickets, we will refund the no longer attending individuals while the remaining can keep their tickets without paying any extra. Feel free to send in your refund request by messaging us on Facebook or through eventbrite or emailing us at csss@ubccsss.org or president@ubccsss.org

We also recognize that it is very possible large gatherings will still be inadvisable at that time. If the Gala is not held by graduation, we will likely have to cancel. We are actively looking into ways to signify and preserve the legacy of the 2020 graduating class, using the Gala budget, should we ultimately cancel; this may be in the form of a bursary, significant facility upgrades, or another symbolic gift. If this course of action comes to pass, we will be making further inquiries into the most appropriate and meaningful ways to spend the funds. Either way, we want to make sure you will still be able to celebrate your years with UBC CS for many years to come.

As your student society, we are committed to your health and safety, as well as serving your needs as CS undergrads and as individuals. Please reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or ideas, and please stay tuned for more updates.
