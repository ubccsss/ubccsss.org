Hey all,

So the CSSS will be hosting our first LAN party of the year and I've gotta say, we are pretty excited.
Are you prepared to test your skills in the art of the frag?
Or if RTS is your style, can you hold your own against the almighty Zerg rush?
Just show up, bring a network cable and your rig, bring your friends and and prepare for awesomeness.

Suggested games:

- Call of Duty
- Counter-Strike
- Team Fortress 2
- Starcraft (1 and 2)
- DoTA
- Unreal Tournament 99

If you have any questions or games you'd like to see, just e-mail [\[emailÂ protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Hope to see you there.

When:

Thursday, September 16, 2010 - 18:00

Where:
