The CSSS will be having our second Semi-Annual General Meeting for the 2016-2017 school year on Thursday, March 16, 2016. All CS students are invited to attend. We will be discussing the current year and also looking for feedback as to how the club is run and how the club will be running next year. We are also going to discuss the election results for the Executive Team next year.
