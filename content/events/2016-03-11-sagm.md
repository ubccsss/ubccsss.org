The CSSS will be having our second Semi-Annual General Meeting for the 2015-16 school year on Tuesday, March 15, 2016. All CS students are invited to attend. We will be discussing the current year and also looking for feedback as to how the club is run and how the club will be running next year. We are also going to discuss the upcoming CSSS Elections for the Executive Team for next year, as well as changes to our constitution.
