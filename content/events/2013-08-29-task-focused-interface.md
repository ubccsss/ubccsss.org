Mik Kersten is from Tasktop Technologies Inc, a local Vancouver company. This talk will interest anybody who uses the Eclipse IDE for software development.

Abstract: In under four years, Mylyn's task-focused interface moved from a UBC whiteboard to the hands of hundreds of thousands of developers. For many, the idea of a tool that hides more of a program than it shows sounded wrong. But the rapid adoption of Mylyn is making the next big step in the evolution of the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) clear. Tasks are more important than files, focus is more important than features, and explicit context has provided developers the biggest productivity boost since structure views and code completion. This talk will discuss the inspirations and research behind Mylyn, demonstrate the tool and the impact it has had, overview the open source ecosystem and startup that we formed around the technology, and conclude with a vision of how the task-focused interface is poised to transform other fields of knowledge work.

Refreshments will be served at 6pm and the lecture will start at 6:30pm. Come early to chat with old friends, or make new friends.
