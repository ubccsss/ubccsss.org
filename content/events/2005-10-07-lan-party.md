Hey everyone! James here! I'm organizing a LAN party for this Friday. Not sure what a LAN Party is? [Check this out](http://www.lanparty.com/theguide/gettingstarted.shtm). Ah, now that you're in the spirit to 0wn, here are the basics.

Time: Friday, Oct 7th. 6pm - 12pm \
Location: X-Wing Lounge, that's the one with Reboot Cafe

Tourney games:
- Unreal Tournament 2004
- Counterstrike: Source

Bring a CAT5 cable to hook up with.

There will also be card games (eg. poker) and board games (eg. Risk) to play.

Free Pizza! (Sponsored by Accenture, thanks!)
