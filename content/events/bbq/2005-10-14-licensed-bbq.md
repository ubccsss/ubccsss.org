<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Come join us after class on Friday, Oct. 14 at the first CSSS Licensed BBQ of the year! The event will be taking place in the student lounge area (outside the Reboot Cafe) of the new wing, and the BBQ will be just outside it, between the old wing and the new wing.</p>
<p>Time: 4:00 - 8:00 p.m. We&apos;ll be starting the BBQ&apos;s up at 4:00 p.m. and the licenced portion of the event will start shortly after 4:00 p.m. as well.</p>
<p>Please note that valid picture ID is required for entrance to the licensed area (the outdoor BBQ will be open to everyone). And if you&apos;re going to join us for the fun, remember to plan a safe trip home (use your UPass!).</p>
<p>Hope to see you at the there!</p>
