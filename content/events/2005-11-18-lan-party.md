The last LAN party was such a success that we're bringing it back! Consider it your last opportunity to game before final exam crunch time :-)

Count on there being a **foosball** tournament, **Risk** deathmatches (risqué indeed), **Unreal Tournament/Enemy Territory** shootouts, and more. And we're also bringing out our new projector hooked up to the Xbox, for 4 player, **Halo 2** action. Fun for the whole family - well, almost. So, even if you protest and deny owning a decent gaming rig, you have no excuse not to come. **Pizza** (for \*genuine\* LAN party attendees) will be available and most likely subsidized by Yours Truly.

Like last time, if you want to suggest improvements and give your input, hit the forums (editor’s note: now closed).
