Local band [TV Heart Attack](https://myspace.com/tvheartattack), recently featured on the PEAK Performance Project and Canadian Music Week will be rocking the stage. Brad DJ Winter is back for another season to keep your feet moving by spinning some mean tracks. Experience the ultimate venue located right off the beach overlooking beautiful English Bay. Meet some new people over a BBQ and drinks. This is a party you don't want to miss. Be a hit with your friends and bring them to party.
