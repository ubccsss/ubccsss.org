<p>We have two great events planned for you in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>The first one is a girls only lunch on Tuesday, January 30th at 12:30 in<br>
room 206.  It&apos;s a great chance for girls to hang out and meet our special<br>
faculty guest - Tamara Munzer.</p>
<p>The second event is a <b>girls Movie Night</b> on <b>Thursday February 8th</b> at<br>
6:00pm in the 7th floor boardroom (room x736).  The movie we will be<br>
showing is Casablanca, a classic that should not be missed. Modest dinner<br>
will be provided as well.</p>
<p>We hope that you can all come to hang out and chat with your fellow<br>
female students.  Feel free to bring your female computer science friends<br>
and spread the word.</p>
