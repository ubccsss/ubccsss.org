Hello girls,

We have two great events planned for you in the next couple of weeks.

The first one is a girls only lunch on Tuesday, January 30th at 12:30 in
room 206. It's a great chance for girls to hang out and meet our special
faculty guest - Tamara Munzer.

The second event is a **girls Movie Night** on **Thursday February 8th** at
6:00pm in the 7th floor boardroom (room x736). The movie we will be
showing is Casablanca, a classic that should not be missed. Modest dinner
will be provided as well.

We hope that you can all come to hang out and chat with your fellow
female students. Feel free to bring your female computer science friends
and spread the word.
