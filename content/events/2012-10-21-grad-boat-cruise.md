The date has been set as **March 31**! That's a Friday for all you without a calendar near by. This year's grad dinner will follow the success of previous years with another fun filled boat cruise.

So... for 20 dollars (there's a healthy subsidy there), you get to spend a one-of-a-kind evening complete with a first-class sit-down dinner aboad a chartered yacht! Last year's event went extremely well, and this year, we expect to do even better!

Menu: Chef Carved Prime Rib Roast Beef, Swiss Potatoes, Vegetarian Penne Pasta in Tomato Sauce, Steamed Vegetables, Three Bean Salad, Caesar Salad, Dinner Rolls, Assorted Pastries for Dessert, Coffee & Tea

Boarding time is **6pm**. The boat will depart at 6:30pm and return later that evening at 10:30 pm.

We're giving preference to graduating students (and one guest), but computer science students from all years are invited to attend. So, if you're interested in going, see your friendly CSSS execs in X139 for more details and to sign up for this exciting event! **You must buy your tickets by Wed Mar 26th! Don't delay!**

When: 

Friday, March 31, 2006 - 17:00 to 21:30

Pick Up/Drop Off: 450 Denman St (North Foot of Denman St)
