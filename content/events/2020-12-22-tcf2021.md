ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the UBC Virtual Technical Career Fair 2021! ðŸŽ‰

Last year, numerous companies attended the Technical Career Fair to meet undergraduate and graduate students from a wide range of disciplines, including Computer Science, Cognitive Systems, Engineering Physics, and Electrical & Computer Engineering. This is a wonderful way for you to showcase your portfolio, and network with a wide range of companies to find out about internships, Co-op, and new grad career opportunities.

Hosted jointly by UBC Computer Science Student Society (CSSS), UBC IEEE, Cognitive Systems Society, and Engineering Physics, the Technical Career Fair will be held virtually on Jan. 21, 2021 @ 10am - 3pm (PST) via Microsoft Teams .
