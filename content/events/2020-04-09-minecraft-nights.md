I hope you all are having fun during the quarantine, we've set up a Minecraft server for people to enjoy (it is actually up at all time so feel free to hop in):

192.99.44.26:25578

There is also a discord channel if people are interested:

Finally, feel free to tell us any other games you are interested in playing, maybe we can host a session!
