Looking for an exciting coding experience? Check out the Google Summer of Code @ Liquid Galaxy info session, brought to you by the CSSS!

Google Summer of Code is an international online program focused on introducing folks to open-source software development. Participants will work with an open source organization — in this case, Liquid Galaxy — on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors. 

The Liquid Galaxy project focuses on developing a panoramic Google Earth-based controller, and has been a GSoC organization since 2011. 

Join Emilie, our VP Academic, past Liquid Galaxy Google Code-in Winner and GSoC co-mentor, for more information on the GSoC program, the Liquid Galaxy project, and application tips!
