**You have received a nudge from CSSS!**

Enjoy the last taste of summer.... (weather permitting)

The first annual CSSS Beach Day will take place on Spanish Banks this Saturday, September 22nd from 2pm to "when the party ends". Activities include 5 on 5 soccer tournament (~$50 prize to winners), volleyball, baseball, and frisbee. Bring something to share, and we'll provide the rest (even ice cream)!

For those of you who don't know where that is, you can come down to Reboot Cafe at 1:30pm and join up with us. For those that don't have rides, come by and we'll find a way to get you down there.
