SO....

Here's the deal. If you and your CS friends want to make up a team for any of the UBC REC intramural leagues or tournaments, the CSSS will subsidize you 3$ for every person on that team.

Day of the Long Boat is coming up, on October 1st and 2nd. The last day to register is Wednesday September 21, and it costs 165$ for a student team. You can register teams of 10-12 in person at the SRC (student recreation centre by the B-line bus loop) OR online at www.rec.ubc.ca.

Once you have registered your team, you can contact [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) so that you can get your subsidized portion of the fee back (save your receipts!!).

There are also a bunch of different league sports happening this term which CSSS will also contribute to if you get a full squad of CS'ers out for. \
For first term the leagues that you can join are:

- ultimate frisbee
- handley cup soccer
- cross volleyball
- nitobe basketball
- todd ice hockey
- bodin ball hockey
- dodgeball
- flag football

Make sure you check WWW.REC.UBC.CA for registration deadlines because they are coming up within the next week or two!!!! You can also find details here about game times and locations.

REC also offers a wide variety of other activites including dance, fitness, marial arts and outdoor activities to name a few. There are smaller one-time tournaments offered through the year -- gladiator, ice wars, pool pandemonium which are also UBER fun, especially if youre looking for that one night of fantastic excitement...

If you have any questions or need clarifications e-mail Jenny your CS sport rep at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) OR you can always go to www.rec.ubc.ca OR swing by the SRC and pick up a program guide for everything you ever wanted to know about sports and recreation at UBC.

SO GO!!!! get away from that computer screen and play play play!!!! (we all need that once and awhile) Find a team, have fun and run around!!! :)
