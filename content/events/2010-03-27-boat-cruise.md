\* \* \* All Tickets Have Been SOLD OUT !!! \* \* \*

It's that time of year again! And with it comes our annual boat cruise with a delicious buffet (which include Oven Roasted Sirloin of Beef Bordelaise and Filet of Fresh British Columbia Salmon in a Herb Crust), music by Melody Express DJ, dancing, mini-games, and Vancouver's finest views!

Our 4-hour boat cruise sailing route will be around the Burrard Inlet, Stanley Park, English Bay, and the False Creek areas.

The original price is $85 per ticket; however, the CSSS is subsidizing $50 for everyone, so now you only need to pay $35 per ticket! And if you pay before March 20th, our Early-Bird price is only $30 per ticket ( including non CS students ). Everyone's welcome!
