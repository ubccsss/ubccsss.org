**UPDATE: GRAD PHOTOS MUST BE TAKEN ASAP! TO BE IN THE COMPOSITE YOU MUST GET YOUR PHOTOS DONE BY MARCH 31st. DON'T MISS IT!!!**

Are you graduating this year? Get your grad photos done now! Grad Portraits are being taken at:

You must get your photos done if you want to be in the class composite and the yearbook (for Dec and May graduation). If you know you won't order any photos, you can book a shortened appointment just to take a picture for the class composite. There is no charge for that.

A regular appointment requires a $35 deposit for the photo previews. If you choose not to order any photos and return the previews undamaged, your money if refunded. If you choose to order photos, that amount is deducted from the package you chose.

Simply phone Evangelos to book your appointment.

Come to the CSSS Office (X139) to pick up an info sheet with tips for getting your grad photos done.
