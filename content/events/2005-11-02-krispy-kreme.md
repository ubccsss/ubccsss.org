On November 2nd, we're going to try something we've never done before.

![](/files/krispykreme.gif)

What happens when we order **600** [Krispy Kreme donuts](http://www.krispykreme.com/) and attempt to consume them all in one day. "_But that's not possible!_" you exclaim! That's right, so we're going to enlist your aid in helping us, if you don't mind.

For the paltry sum of \[_amount to be announced once our math whizzes have finished deliberating_\], you'll be helping us rid the campus of donuts, the likes of which UBC has never seen before. And also, your generously given coin will help Your Student Society arrange bigger and more lavish things for you.

It would be a shame if the engineers beat you to it. So come out next Wednesday... For great justice!

$1 for one donut \
$2 for three donuts \
$8 per dozen

When:

Wednesday, November 2, 2005 - 10:00 to 12:00

Where:

Between CICSR and Dempster
