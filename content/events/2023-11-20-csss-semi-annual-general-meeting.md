Wanna learn more about what the CSSS has been up to this term? Join us at our Semi-Annual General Meeting, where our exec team goes over updates on what we've been doing! We will also be having a Q&A session where you can give feedback on what we can do better, as well as suggest anything you want to see for the upcoming term!

We will also be voting on several amendments to the club Constitution. [View the proposed amendments here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aYxSUmlTGe5sdnj65vMt0X7FUuFiRAieGgXN-FqZUGI/edit).
