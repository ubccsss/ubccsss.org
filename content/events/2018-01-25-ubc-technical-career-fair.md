🎉 Welcome to the 2018 Technical Career Fair! 🎉

Last year, over 50 companies attended the Tech Career Fair to meet undergraduate and graduate students from a wide range of disciplines, including Computer Science, Cognitive Systems, Engineering Physics, and Electrical & Computer Engineering. This is a wonderful way for you to showcase your portfolio, and network with a wide range of companies to find out about internships and post-graduate career opportunities.

Hosted jointly by UBC Computer Science Student Society - CSSS, UBC IEEE, Cognitive Systems Society, and Engineering Physics, the 2018 Technical Career Fair will be held on Thu. Jan. 25, 2018 @ 10am-4pm in the West Atrium of the UBC Life Sciences Centre.
