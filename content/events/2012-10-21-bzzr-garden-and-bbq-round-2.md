![](/files/BeerGarden_image.jpg)This Friday come to the 2nd CSSS BBQ and Bzzr Garden from 4 - 8pm in the X-wing Lounge! This one will be even better than the last one, with a better tap system so that hopefully there won't be any lines. We'll be serving Granville Island, like last time. Come for great food, tasty drinks and good company!

Remember to plan ahead for a safe ride home... use your U-Pass! You've already paid for it!

See you there!

When:

Friday, February 3, 2006 - 15:00 to 19:00
