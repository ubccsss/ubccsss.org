Coming up is the first ever <strong>Wine and Cheese event</strong>  (And no, we&apos;re not talking about <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">Wine</a>, which imho, is also quite sophisticated too). Tantalize your five senses and don&apos;t miss out.</p>
<p>If the idea of rubbing shoulders with faculty, and students alike while sipping a stem of Pinot Noir doesn&apos;t appeal to you, consider the cultural enrichment that you&apos;d get knowing that there are more varieties of cheese than Chedder or Mozza.  It&apos;s all the fun of joining the <a href="http://www.ams.ubc.ca/clubs/winetasting">UBC Wine Tasting Club</a> with none of the commitment! ;-)</p>
<p>Entertainment will be provided by the band &apos;<strong>Lango Lock</strong>&apos; featuring CS undergrad Anthony Lee, and UBC CS graduate Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Tickets will be on sale for $5.00 at the CSSS office</strong> starting Friday (Nov. 18), <strong>won&apos;t be available at the door</strong>, and are limited in number, so be sure to get yours early! The ticket includes <strong>food and entertainment</strong>, and wine will be for sale by the glass.  Also note that all graduating students who attend will automatically be entered into a draw to <strong>win one of three $70 Gift Certificates with Evangelos Photography</strong>.  Eat, drink, be merry, <em>and</em> save some dough on your grad photos!</p>
<p>The event is semi-formal, so be sure to break out your nice duds and leave the sweats and lululemons at home.</p>
<p>This event is brought to you by the Computer Science Students&apos; Society (CSSS) and the Computer Science Graduate Students&apos; Assocation (CSGSA).</p>
