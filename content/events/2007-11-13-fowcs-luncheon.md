Hello ladies!

FoWCS will be holding its November luncheon this Friday, November 16th at noon. As usual, female graduate and undergraduate CS students are invited to come. We especially encourage 1st year undergrads to attend and network with other female students in the department. There will be light refreshments.

(Note: The room, X836, is in the ICICS building, in the X wing. Press the 7th floor button on the elevator located in the X-wing.)

Don't be shy. Drop by, even if it's just to say hello and grab some snacks!

Please RSVP to us at: \

by Nov 15th so we'll know how much food to get. If you have any allergies or preferences for food, let us know!

Feel free to join our facebook group, Focus on Women in Computer Science, as well.

Thank you!
