Everybody, both past and present, and in any discipline is invited to come!</p>
<p>If you&apos;re graduating, you have no excuse not to come.  Even if you&apos;re an undergrad, it&apos;s a great way to get a headstart, whether you&apos;re a co-op student, or looking for summer internships, or just want to know what&apos;s out there.  Visit the SUB Ballroom, and meet representatives from local technology companies and firms, and use those networking skills and <a href="http://www.creativekeys.net/PowerfulPresentations/article1024.html">elevator speeches</a>.  Or come to the multitude of employer information sessions scheduled throughout the day to find out more about a specific company through a presentation.</p>
<p>Careerfair news will be posted as it arrives.  Info session schedules will be posted in the next few weeks or so, as well as the floor plan at the <a href="//cf06.ubccsss.org/" target="parent">main page for the career fair</a>.</p>
