Mark your calendars for the largest UBC CSSS end-of-the-year event! Weâ€™re happy to bring it back this year after being on hiatus since 2019! The event will be held at the UBC Boathouse on April 5, from 6 pm - 11 pm. Ticket sales will begin on March 9th at 10 am!

Early bird pricing will start at $40 (plus the Eventbrite ticket fee) and will end on March 21st at 11:59 pm. After that, ticket prices will be $50 (plus the Eventbrite ticket fee) until registration closes at 11:59 pm on March 30th. Make sure you claim your spot as soon as possible as seats are limited!

Please register using the Eventbrite link [here](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/ubc-csss-year-end-gala-tickets-571282129227)!

After purchasing your ticket, please fill out this [Google Form](https://forms.gle/8VtVNFhANp5vgvB46) to select your menu option and seating preferences. Please also submit the same email address that was used to purchase the ticket so we can link them together.

Tickets are heavily subsidized by the UBC CSSS and will include a 4-course plated dinner with an open bar, fun activities, a DJ, and a Photo Booth so make sure you come dressed up in semi-formal attire!
