Title: Physical Interface Design and Communication Through Touch

Abstract: I'm interested in how people communicate through the sense of touch, and how haptic information transfer interacts with perception in other modalities. As time and interest permit, I’ll discuss two very different kinds of haptic communication that my group has been studying recently. The first is _abstract_ information, delivered one-way to your hand encoded in complex vibrations. We’ve found that humans are better at this than you might expect—depending on how the sensations are created; and the medium has potential for low-effort, background communication. In the second kind, we’re examining haptically communicated _affect_: what’s behind feels that we like or don’t like—can this be predicted or quantified? How do we communicate emotion haptically, to people or animals, and is this an essential part of emotional communication more generally? We're building a highly sensed animatronic Creature as an experimental platform, which we plan to use for basic study and in a therapeutic setting.

We’ll meet this time in the HCI Learning Studio, a resource created with a special grant by the CS HCI faculty for studio-style courses. Snacks possibly available for early arrivals.
