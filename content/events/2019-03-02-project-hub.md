Is startup success about skill or luck? How do incubators work? What are the different types of startups? Jon Mercer, a UBC alumni and former Launch Pad co-president, began his startup journey when he joined an incubator called Next36. From there, he worked on his startup with his co-founder part-time for a year and a half before taking the plunge and quitting their jobs to work on it full-time. Come hear about how startups work, find out what they did right, and learn from their mistakes at the third session of Project Hub, a joint UBC Launch Pad and UBC Computer Science Student Society - CSSS initiative, taking place this Saturday afternoon!

Project Hub meetings occur biweekly and consist of a talk or workshop about a particular technology or skill (either by industry professionals, Launch Pad members, or someone else from the UBC community), followed by an open workspace where everyone can work on their projects, ask for help, network, and explore new ideas - complete with snacks and refreshments! üç™

We hope to see you there! üéâ
