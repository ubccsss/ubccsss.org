![](/files/geng_lin_picture.jpg)Traditionally communications network has been considered synonymous with connectivity. Focus for network research and development was majorly on bandwidth, availability and protocol interoperability. While these factors continue to play an important role in the future network R&D, a new set of business challenges and opportunities such as mission critical business applications, self-defending security networks, and network as a distributed computing platform, is emerging and requires the attention of network researchers and developers.

In this talk, we will discuss the evolution of network intelligence and its impact on distributed computing and distributed applications. This talk assumes the perspective of a business leader or an entrepreneur and examines the potential business opportunities that are associated with this technological transformation. In particular we will discuss business cases associated with emerging technologies such as content-based message routing, network deep packet inspection, network-as-distributed-database, network-enabled stateless server, etc.
