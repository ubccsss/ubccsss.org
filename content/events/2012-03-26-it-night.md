### Thank you for coming!

IT Night was a success and we are looking forward to an even better night next year. Should you have any questions regarding recruiting opportunities, or anything else, please don't hesitate to contact us.

We would also love to hear any suggestions that you might have for improving IT Night. While many of us are graduating, we do pass on these suggestions to next year's executive.

### Why Consider a UBC CS Student?

Google recruits from two schools in Canada: Waterloo and UBC. Microsoft has hired Program Managers from at least the last two graduating classes. We don't know exactly what UBC CS students have, but clearly some students are very employable.

Here are some of the things that may make UBC CS students worth looking at:

*   Built SQL databases and GUI front ends to run them
*   Managed teams of 8 in semester long project only courses
*   Designed interfaces incorporating principles of Human Computer Interaction (HCI)
*   Implemented and designed online shopping systems from the DB to the UI
*   Written and deployed web servers
*   Worked with API's and Frameworks
*   Java, C++, C, C#
*   ASP, ASP.Net, XML, Cold Fusion, PHP
*   Linux, Unix, Windows
