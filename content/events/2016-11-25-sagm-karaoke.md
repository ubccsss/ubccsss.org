The Computer Science Student Society invites all of our members to the first Semi-Annual General Meeting of the year! If you have any questions about the CSSS or like to give input about the club and discuss club matters, this is a great opportunity to do so. There will be food provided at the meeting. We're also hosting a karaoke night after the meeting (at around 6:30), so invite your friends to swing by and sing to your heart's content!

The agenda for the meeting can be found here: [https://ubccsss.org/files/AGMAgenda.pdf](/files/AGMAgenda.pdf)
