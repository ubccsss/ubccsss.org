Welcome to new UBC students and welcome back to returning students! Thanks to everyone who volunteered at the Imagine Day BBQ ([view photos](https://photos.app.goo.gl/58eSPEGfPT8TLsMSA)) in front of the [ICICS building](http://icics.ubc.ca/). If you didn't get to come, don't worry as there are plenty more events from the CSSS coming up.
