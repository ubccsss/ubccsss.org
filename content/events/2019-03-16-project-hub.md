Feel like your websites are lacking in bling and dimensions? Come learn the basics of computer graphics and how to incorporate it into your personal website using Three.js from Launch Pad's tech leads at our fourth session of Project Hub, a joint UBC Launch Pad and CSSS initiative, taking place this Saturday afternoon! The workshop will cover concepts like path tracing and projects, and will expect you to be some familiarity with JavaScript.

Project Hub meetings occur biweekly and consist of a talk or workshop about a particular technology or skill (either by industry professionals, Launch Pad members, or someone else from the UBC community), followed by an open workspace where everyone can work on their projects, ask for help, network, and explore new ideas - complete with snacks and refreshments! üç™

We hope to see you there! üéâ
