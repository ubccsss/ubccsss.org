Hey all,

Join your fellow Cubers for a fun afternoon of ice skating at the Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Winter Sports Centre. Admission is free as we will be going during free skating time, and the Arena knows we'll be coming. Feel free to drop by and skate, whether you can make it for the whole time, or just a few minutes.
If you don't have skates, UBC Thunderbird Arena rents skates out at $3.50. Their sizes range from child 8 to adult 13.

Please email if you plan to attend, and whether you need skate rentals, so we can get an idea of numbers.

When:

Friday, November 12, 2010 - 15:15 to 17:45

Where:

Doug Mitchell Thunderbird Winter Sports Centre
