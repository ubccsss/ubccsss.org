Curious about the election results, or just wondering what we do here at the CSSS? Come to our Annual General Meeting to have all your questions answered! Our executives will share reports on all the events their teams have organized over the past term, such as the Tech Career Fair and the CS Gala, and there will be opportunities for you to provide your input on how we can do better as a club.
