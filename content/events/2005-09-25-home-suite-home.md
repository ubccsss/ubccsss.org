If you've got the new [Home Suite Home CD](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/local/computing/software/hsh/), but have no idea what to do with the coaster that you've got, consider coming out to this tutorial!

A Home Suite Home tutorial will be held on Thursday September 29th, 12:30-13:30 in DMP 301. If you are having problems getting your JDK set up at home, this is the place to go. An overview of remote computing will also be given - e.g., secure file transfer, etc. The tutorial will be run by Charles Kryszik who is a senior undergraduate student in the department and who put together the HSH CD.

Come and learn about:

*   Jdk1.5 / Eclipse 3.1 installation/troubleshooting and common issues.
*   Firefox/Thunderbird installation/setup to access your CS-Account email from home.
*   How to handin your assignments electronically.
*   File transfer between home and school.
