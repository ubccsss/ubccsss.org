If you've got the new [Home Suite Home CD](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/local/computing/software/hsh/), but have no idea what to do with the coaster that you've got, consider coming out to this tutorial!

A Home Suite Home tutorial will be held on Thursday September 29th, 12:30-13:30 in DMP 301. If you are having problems getting your JDK set up at home, this is the place to go.
