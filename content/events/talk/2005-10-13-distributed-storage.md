The reasons for preferring such a structure are increased fault-tolerance, scalability, and economics. However, the distributed nature of the system can make it complex to design, difficult to implement, and nearly impossible to test making the whole enterprise a daunting one. One of the ways of reducing the complexity of distributed storage systems is to first design a set of simple abstractions and services that can then be composed easily to provide the required functionality. The talk will illustrate examples of this technique with reference to some systems -- Petal &apos;96, Frangipani &apos;97, Boxwood &apos;04, and Eclipse &apos;05-- on which I have worked. These systems demonstrate that it is feasible to build complex storage systems using a set of building blocks that are easy to design, implement, and test. </p>
