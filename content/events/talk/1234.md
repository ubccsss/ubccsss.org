<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Abstract:<br>
Pixar, recently receiving an Oscar for the movie &apos;WALL-E&apos;, has developed some of the world&apos;s most advanced techniques for generating computer animated feature films.  In this talk I will discuss the research and development that occurs at Pixar and the technologies behind the film production process.  My talk will also demonstrate the wide range of computer science disciplines required to create animated feature films, including software engineering, databases, networks, algorithms, compilers, operating systems, and computer graphics.  Sequences from many of our feature films will be used as a case study for presenting how the various pieces of technology come together to create the final product.</p>
