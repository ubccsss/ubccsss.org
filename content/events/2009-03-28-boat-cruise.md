The year is almost over and everyone deserves a break—how better than a dinner cruise? Your ticket includes the ~4 hour cruise, a full dinner (check the [menu](/files/2009-cruise-menu.pdf) but ignore the price listed there as it's included in your ticket), and one glass of wine (your choice of white or red). Bring 2 pieces of ID if you'll be drinking. Dress formally!

Tickets are $35 and can be purchased in the CSSS office, ICICS X139.

When:

Saturday, March 28, 2009 - 18:30 to 23:00

Where:

Harbour Cruises Marina—#1 North Foot of Denman Street
