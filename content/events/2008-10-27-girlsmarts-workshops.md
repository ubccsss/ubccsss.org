The GIRLsmarts workshop is a one-day computer science workshop for girls in grade 6. The workshops have been very successful in the past few years mainly due to the help of enthusiastic volunteers. We are looking to continue this tradition and we need your help. With the rewards of a volunteer dinner, cool thank you gifts and the knowledge that you have helped inspire interest in computer science for young women, this is definitely a great and fun way to pad those résumés.

The workshops are planned to happen on January 31st and February 7th of next year.

We're looking for enthusiastic and responsible people to join us and help with GIRLsmarts. We have different positions available including activity facilitators and group leaders. All the activities are already planned so the amount of work required for volunteers is quite minimal. For more details on the program and on the volunteers positions offered please refer to the website: [http://www.jadeproject.ca/girlsmarts/index.html](http://www.jadeproject.ca/girlsmarts/index.html). \
