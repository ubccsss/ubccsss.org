Affect the future of the CSSS and the Cube! Breaking changes may occur, including redesigning the Cube, new academic impact, and future events.

If you have any questions about the CSSS or would like to give input about the club and discuss club matters, this is a great opportunity to do so. There will be FREE FOOD provided at the meeting.

We'll be proposing a new VP Academic position at the meeting, moving towards students and the CSSS having an effect on the curriculum.
