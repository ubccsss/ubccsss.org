**Schedule:**

- 5:15 pm – 6:00 pm panel
- 6:00 pm – 6:30 pm Zoom breakout rooms with panel members

Overwhelmed by industry recommendations to have personal projects, but don’t know where to start? Know what you want to create, but procrastinating? Uncertain about tools to use to keep your project on track? Challenged by how to package your projects to show to employers? Join us on March 9 for a panel of both industry professionals and students who will discuss and answer **YOUR** questions about personal projects.

The panel moderator will be UBC CS associate professor Ivan Beschastnikh. Panelists include industry members Jerry Jim (VP Technology with Central 1 Credit Union and CPSC 319 instructor), Christin Wiedemann (Director, Quality Engineering, Slalom Build) George Chow (SFU lecturer previously working in senior management roles at Simba Technologies) and Gokce Dilek (4th year CS major). Immediately following the panel there will be facilitated Zoom break out rooms where you can ask panelists more specific questions within a more informal setting.

**RSVP at https://my.cs.ubc.ca/event/2022/03/personal-projects-panel by Mon. March 7 end of day.**
