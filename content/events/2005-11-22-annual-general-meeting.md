The CSSS will be having an AGM on Thursday Sept. 22 from 12:30 - 1:30 pm. This will be happening in the Student Lounge (near Reboot Cafe). We'll talk about some events we are planning, and then we'll open up the floor to get feedback from students. Everyone is invited!

You should come if you:

- have any suggestions or comments for CSSS
- are interested in hearing about upcoming events
- want to see the execs up close and in person!
- want free chips!

We'll also be giving away the prizes for the Who's Who Contest!

Hope to see you there!
