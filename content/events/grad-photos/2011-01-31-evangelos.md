<p>Evangelos Photography<br>
3156 West Broadway, Vancouver<br>
(604)731-8314 / 732-3023</p>

<p>You must get your photos done if you want to be in the class composite and the yearbook (for Dec and May graduation). Photos taken at another company (such as Artona) will not be included in this years composite. If you know you won&apos;t order any photos, you can book a shortened appointment just to take a picture for the class composite. There is no charge for that.</p>
<p>A regular appointment requires a $35 deposit for the photo previews. If you choose not to order any photos and return the previews undamaged, your money if refunded. If you choose to order photos, that amount is deducted from the package you chose.</p>
<p>Simply phone Evangelos to book your appointment. The deadline for photos is January 31st</p>
<p>Come to the CSSS Office (X139) to pick up an info sheet with tips for getting your grad photos done.</p>
