From November 10 to 28, the Computer Science Student Society will be
collecting donations of nonperishable food and money for the Greater
Vancouver Food Bank. We will be accepting donations in our lounge (ICICS
X139). Please bring out a can or two of soup or a few dollars and help
set a great goal for next year's class to beat while helping out those
in need!
