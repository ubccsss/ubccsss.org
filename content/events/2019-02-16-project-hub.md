Welcome to Week 2 of Project Hub, a joint UBC Launch Pad and UBC Computer
Science Student Society - CSSS initiative!

Have lots of project ideas but don't know where to start? 😨Have no project
ideas and don't know where to start? 😱This Saturday's Project Hub is for you!
The meeting will feature a talk by one of Launch Pad's tech leads about the
high-level techniques, skills, and considerations involved in bringing an idea
to life to help you get started on your killer project this reading week! 💪You
can also stick around afterwards for help as well!

Project Hub meetings occur biweekly and consist of a talk or workshop about a
particular technology or skill (either by industry professionals, Launch Pad
members, or someone else from the UBC community), followed by an open workspace
where everyone can work on their projects, ask for help, network, and explore
new ideas - complete with snacks and refreshments! 🍪

We hope to see you there! 🎉
