ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the 2019 Technical Career Fair! ðŸŽ‰

Last year, over 50 companies attended the Tech Career Fair to meet undergraduate and graduate students from a wide range of disciplines, including Computer Science, Cognitive Systems, Engineering Physics, and Electrical & Computer Engineering. This is a wonderful way for you to showcase your portfolio, and network with a wide range of companies to find out about internships and post-graduate career opportunities.

Hosted jointly by UBC Computer Science Student Society (CSSS), UBC IEEE, Cognitive Systems Society, and Engineering Physics, the Technical Career Fair will be held on Jan. 31, 2019 @ 10am-4pm in the West Atrium of the UBC Life Sciences Centre.
