It's time for school again! Are you new to UBC Computer Science? Then come on out to the welcome event put on by the Computer Science department!

_"Say what?"_

- Thursday, September 8 @ DMP 310, 12:30-1:15PM

You'll get the chance to meet some of your future professors, academic advisors, co-op coordinators, as well as mingle among some of your fellow newbies who you hadn't met on Imagine Day! You'll get to hear from the department head of Computer Science, Bill Aiello, as well as the president of Your Student Society(TM), Rachel Chao!

**Not only that, you'll get FREE pizza!**

Afterward, head on down to the X-Wing (TIE Fighter!) student lounge, located near the Reboot Cafe.

_"What's that?"_

You'll get a chance to mingle even more with fellow students and Computer Science faculty. Got a question about your classes? Just ask someone! Wanna brag about the program you've been working on? Go ahead!
