![](/files/header_logo.jpg)Let’s face it — the world needs help. The kind of help that happens when you take the top young minds from around the globe and turn them loose on solving the world’s toughest problems. That’s what the Imagine Cup is all about. This is your chance to innovate and create, show the world what you’ve got, and win some serious prizes. Simply put, it’s your chance to use the power of technology to change the world—and have some fun while you’re at it. Come to see how you can win a trip to Seoul, South Korea in **Microsoft's 2007 Imagine Cup Kickoff**. Featuring Software Development, Algorithm, AI, IT, Web challenges, and more.
