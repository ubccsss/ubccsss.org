![](/files/victoryodaiken.jpg)_FSMLabs produces RTLinux, the popular real-time operating system. Dr. Yodaiken is in Vancouver specifically to announce the formal opening of the company’s newly-established Vancouver office._

Modular programming is difficult in a real-time environment efficiency is critical and where interactions that change timing can cause hidden dependencies. RTLinux decouples real-time from non-real-time and provides the programmer some methods of separating programs into simpler components and the first part of this talk will cover the interfacing of real-time and non-real-time modules and connecting real-time software to networked services. The second part will look at modularity within real- time components particularly on limiting the global timing effects of synchronization.
