Just in time for the start of term is a barbeque! Our barbeques have always been a popular and culinary success with your friendly neighbourhood CSSS execs behind the grill. Everybody is invited!

Prices are **$2 for a burger** and **50 cents for a sweet tasting carbonated beverage** otherwise known as a "pop". First year CS students get a free burger upon display of their student ID card and answer to a skill testing question to verify CS student status _(okay, we were joking about the last part)_.

When:

Thursday, September 14, 2006 - 12:00 to 14:00

Where:
