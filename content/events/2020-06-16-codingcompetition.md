Join us this Saturday for our Summer Coding Competition!

Make a few new friends and sharpen up your coding and problem-solving skills.

Whether you want to brave the sea by yourself or with the help of your buddies (ELECTED by you or APPOINTED by us) solve your way through our course of problems curated by the CSSS team.

With your assigned team, and with teamwork, creativity, and collaboration, we believe you will come out having learned something new, or a couple new friends.

Sign up - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeuq2BFyhcs4F9LQ4mou-CYQ_EINOa2UD5Sm-OPq9tXnl814w/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1Eam4e6LSGCUjV8LnsgzsQfx_8NM6X_aG67ERwyOlT9txA1rzSS4uyjSg

We will send out our Zoom Meeting link Saturday morning via EMAIL. Please have every group member sign up!

The top-scoring team will walk away with a $50 Amazon gift card!
