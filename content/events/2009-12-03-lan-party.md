UNSTOPPABLE! WICKED SICK! M-M-M-MONSTER KILL! GODLIKE!

If you like dominating your opponents, this is the place to be. Many people wanted to play DotA last time so we're definitely featuring it this time round. WC3 with the latest DotA map will be provided at the LAN party, if you haven't got it installed.

Other games will be available too, so you're still welcome if you don't play either of the above.

REMEMBER TO BRING YOUR LAPTOP!!!

Games to be played:

- DotA
- CS: Source
- Warcraft III
- Starcraft
- TF2
- L4D
- Halo 1

When:

Thursday, December 3, 2009 - 17:00 to 23:00
