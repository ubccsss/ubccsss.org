If you're **graduating this December or April**, make sure you get your graduation photos done! Graduation photos are being taken by [Evangelos Photography](http://www.evangelosphotography.com/). Evangelos will provide all necessary caps, hoods and gowns and will take a variety of poses from which you can choose your class composite. Please note that there are **no fees or charges** for this service. Also, note that if you wish, you can take photos with other studios but you MUST at minimum, take a single pose with Evangelos which will go into the composite photo.

To book your appointment, phone Evangelos at 604-738-8314 or 604-732-3023. You must book your appointment by **December 31, 2007**!

Evangelos is only 7 minutes from UBC at [3145 West Broadway, Vancouver](https://maps.google.ca/maps?q=3145+West+Broadway&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF-8&client=firefox-a&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1).
