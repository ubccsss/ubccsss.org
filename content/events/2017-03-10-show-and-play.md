We have a ton of cool games in games in the Cube, but they're often neglected for that one particular game. So we've decided to give a chance for these forgotten gems to shine. One day every week, we will showcasing a video game and a board game, so you can come to the Cube to try them out.

We will be starting this Friday at 4:30pm and this week we will be showcasing the video game Nintendoland and the board game Dominion.

Have your own (multiplayer) game that you think would be cool for people to try? Feel free to bring it in and share the fun!
