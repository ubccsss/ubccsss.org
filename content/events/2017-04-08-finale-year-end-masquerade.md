You are a secret agent sent to infiltrate a masquerade party attended by top computer scientists in the world to steal a top-secret prime factorization algorithm. Since everyone is behind a mask, you can easily hide your true identity. But little did you know there are other spies hiding among the masked participants at the party...

Celebrate the end of classes and have a nice break before the start of exams by coming to our biggest event of the year! Get ready for a night filled with fun spy-themed activities, prizes and dancing at a beautiful venue.

We will be providing a catered dinner with amazing dessert and, of course, drinks. There will be also be a photobooth and DJ.
