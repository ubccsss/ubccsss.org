#### WHAT

We're inviting you to celebrate a beautiful UBC summer in front of the ICICS building with some meats and veggies fresh off the grill. Be sure to bring your friends, kick back, and relax!

If you're on co-op, this is a great excuse to come visit your friends (and make some new ones) back on campus. :)

#### WHEN

From 4 to 7 pm on June 28th, 2019

#### WHY

Why not? It's BBQ season!

#### WHO

Slava, the VP Ex will be manning the grill. He is the guy that breakdances at year-end gala.
