<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Google, together with the Focus on Women in Computer Science (FoWCS) committee, is hosting a luncheon for women in Computer Science at UBC and you&apos;re invited!</p>
<p>Shauna Eggers, Software Engineer at Google, will give a TechTalk about<br>
Google News Personalization with additional time<br>
for mingling and Q&amp;A.</p>
<!--break--><p>Talk Abstract:<br>
Several approaches to collaborative filtering have been studied but seldom have the studies been reported for large (several millions of users and items) and dynamic (the underlying item set is continually changing) settings. In this talk I&apos;ll describe our approach to collaborative filtering for generating personalized recommendations for users of Google News. Our approach is content agnostic and consequently domain independent, making it easily adaptable for other applications and languages with minimal effort. This talk will describe our algorithms and system setup in detail, and report results of running the recommendations engine on Google News.</p>
