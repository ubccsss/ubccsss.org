Do you want to work on side projects with friends? Learn a new skills from other
students? Eat free food? Come to Project Hub!

Project Hub meetings occur biweekly and consist of a talk or workshop about a
particular technology or skill (either by industry professionals, Launch Pad
members, or someone else from the UBC community), followed by an open workspace
where everyone can work on their projects, ask for help, network, and explore
new ideas - complete with snacks and refreshments! 🍪

We hope to see you there! Join our Slack workspace
