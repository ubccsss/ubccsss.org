students? Eat free food? Come to Project Hub!

Project Hub meetings occur biweekly and consist of a talk or workshop about a

members, or someone else from the UBC community), followed by an open workspace
where everyone can work on their projects, ask for help, network, and explore
new ideas - complete with snacks and refreshments! üç™
