Just a quick note...

If you want to play in the foosball tournament, you can sign up on the bulletin board outside the cube office, OR at the LAN party on friday. There will be a final showdown, one on one between the winning team to see who gets to take home a brand spankin' new copy of NBA Live '06 for Xbox.
