If you are intending to graduate in Nov. 2014 or May 2015, please be advised Artona is the official grad photographer for UBC Computer Science. Appointments are now open for term one (more dates and times will be available later). To ensure you are on the department composite, you need to be photographed at the Artona studio.

*   Session includes professional business, formal, and grad portraits.
*   There is no sitting fee, but don't forget the $60 deposit! (See [PDF](/files/20141017artona.pdf) for details)
