Didn't get enough of the BBQ-goodness in our last welcome barbeque a few weeks ago? No worries, for we are hosting the **Arbitrary Barbeque** this Thursday! Something for everybody - fun for the whole family. As always, you're invited and you can experience the arbitrariness of it all. Better that it is "arbitrary" than the "midterm" BBQ coming up... soon.

As always, our low, low prices apply - **$2 for a burger** and **50 cents for your choice of a pop [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR) a bag of chips**. We undercut [everybody](http://www.ams.ubc.ca/content.cfm?ID=47).

When: 

Thursday, September 28, 2006 - 12:00 to 14:00

Where: 

Outside Dempster
