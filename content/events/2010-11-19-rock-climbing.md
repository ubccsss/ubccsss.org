Hey all,

We will be holding a rock climbing event this Friday, Nov. 19th at Cliffhanger climbing gym, Vancouver. Event starts at 1800 until 2000. For everyone who wants to come, we will be selling tickets in the Cube office (ICICS X139) for $10 (cash only). This is an awesome deal as we're subsidizing some of the cost. Also, there are only 20 tickets available so get yours now!

Cliffhanger is a climbing gym located at 670 Industrial Ave., Vancouver BC V6A 2P3. \
