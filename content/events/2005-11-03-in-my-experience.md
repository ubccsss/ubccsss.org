![](/files/presentor.jpg)For those of you who didn't attend this extremely popular event last year, **In My Experience** is basically the straight-dope on Computer Science. Hear from several CS students, in all stages of their degree and what they are doing. If you have that burning question, like, "Should I go into co-op?" (of course!), or "Should I do a double major or honours?" (well, duhhh...), this is the place to get your answers - from peers who've had to make those same choices.

What's the state of CS in general? Hear why those naysayers who claim we're doomed to be unemployed upon graduation are very wrong. All past participants have agreed that this was extremely helpful so don't miss out!

And... ahem, where there be speakers, there be giveaways ;-) But even if you don't get to snag a t-shirt or one of those newfangled cdroms, I guarantee you that you'll definitely snag something way more valuable - helpful advice that could make a difference in your education or career. It's what you make of it, and it's your experience!
