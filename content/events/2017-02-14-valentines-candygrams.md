Love is in the air. Whether it's a special someone or a really good friend, we all have someone we would like to show our appreciation to. The UBC Computer Science Student Society will help you do just that by delivering\* candygrams filled with yummy chocolates and candies on Valentine's Day (Tuesday, February 14) to these special people.

To make it even better, this service will be FREE for the first 150 students enrolled in the CS department as well as first year students. (Max 1 free candygram per student)

\*Delivery locations will be limited to CS classes and labs.

If you want to send a candygram, just fill out the form below.
