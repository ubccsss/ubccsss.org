### How do I join?

**You don't have to! As long as you're a Computer Science student, you're a
member!**

### What can we do for you?

Expect BBQs (weather permitting), free breakfasts, board games nights, 
Industry Panels and Info Sessions, volunteer opportunities within the Computer Science department, 
the highly-anticipated Career Fair, and social events such as our year-end gala!

We also distribute all kinds of free stuff. Snag cool retractable CSSS pens and
blue whiteboard markers, deck out your laptop with our signature CSSS and Cube 
vinyl stickers, pause your reading with a CSSS bookmark, or just come listen
to the complimentary sage advice being dispensed in our clubroom.

So come by and socialize with your CS peers; hang out, eat and be merry! We
organize tons of events just for CS students. We can also help you dial into
the rest of UBC CS. Find a home in the department by getting involved 
with various volunteer opportunities. Increase your connections by networking
with industry members at the career fair. And of course, we also stock cheap food
([Food Price List](/cube/menu)). Forget those greedy vending machines — we're not
pirates.

### Where is the CSSS lounge?

You can find us in [ICICS 021](/cube/location/). Head just down the stairs from the front door
of ICICS/CS, turn right, and we'll be at the end of the hallway, beside the undergraduate labs.

### How do I find out about CSSS events?

We'll be publishing our events here on our website (which also has an
[RSS feed](/index.xml)), [Tweeting them](https://twitter.com/ubccsss), posting
them on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ubccsss/), and sending them
to our [announcements mailing list](/contact/email-newsletter/).

### How can I volunteer for CSSS events?

We're always looking for volunteers to help with our events. Please see our
[upcoming volunteer opportunities](/volunteer) for more information.

### How can I be involved in the running of CSSS?

Just ask! We're always happy to bring more people on board. Our organization has a
three-layer reporting structure: the president, the other core executives, and
the committees. The president and core executives are elected each spring, while committee
members are appointed throughout the year. If you see a position that interests
you, or just want to get involved, shoot us an e-mail at
`csss [at] ubccsss [dot] org`.

### Our Mission Statement and Constitution

To forge a meaningful relationship between the Computer Science students and the
department, to expand students' networking opportunities and industry contacts,
and to construct a supportive and fun environment within the undergraduate
community. We carry out our mission by: encouraging students to volunteer in
Department related events, organizing the highly anticipated Career Fair, and
holding social events.

For more information about the running of the club, please read our
[constitution](/about/constitution).

Thanks everyone! If you have any questions/concerns, please e-mail us at
