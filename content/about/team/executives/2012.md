      I’m a 4th year student who is majoring in Cognitive Systems (probably going to change majors to Computer Science). I don’t have much of a particular interest in much of anything when it comes to school, though it turns out I really like CPSC 320 so far. It’s like a course on puzzle solving with just enough math to make it beautiful, but not difficult. If I was to describe myself as I am right now, it would be with a quote by Eleanor Rooseevelt: “I am who I am today, because of the choices I made yesterday.” I am, as much as I hate to admit it, a mere worm of a man and I work hard to build up my character every day. Well, at least I’m motivated to change myself. Oh, and it’s worth mentioning I was not elected, but appointed as president and am struggling to figure out what I’m supposed to do. Other than that, I enjoy listening to jazz, working out, watching animé, and playing DOTA, though I don’t get much time for video games these days.

      I’ve been a proud member of the CSSS since the first day I set foot in it. It has given me so many great opportunities and chances in meeting and working with so many different people that it was a no brainer to give back by getting involved, and I encourage you to do so as well! In my spare time I enjoy cycling, swimming, baseball, coding, and, of course, the vidya. Say hi if you see me!
  - position: Vice President, Communications
    name: Matthew Arnold

      I’m Matthew Arnold, a 3rd year Computer Science student at UBC. I’m a big gamer, so I play Q3A, CS, TF2, DotA, and SCII. I hope to help the CSSS be a welcoming place so that CS undergrads have somewhere to hang out and talk.

      I am a third-year student doing a major in Computer Science with a minor in Commerce. I have participated in CSSS initiatives before and wanted to be an exec ever since I entered UBC. I am currently on co-op doing some pretty exciting stuff (that’s never been done before!!). I am interested in problem solving and finding ways to optimize solutions to a problem, even at my workplace. Outside of school, I enjoy working out, swimming, and hanging out with friends. If you have questions about any of the social events, have any ideas, or just want to say a hi, hit me up at the e-mail address above or whenever you see me around campus.
