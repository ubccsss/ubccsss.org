On this page, you can find records of past meetings which have been dutifully
described in great detail by our Secretaries.

As always, we encourage you, as a CS student, to play an active role in the
CSSS. Should you have any concerns regarding anything or if you would like us to
address a subject, let us know and we'll be happy to discuss it!
