### Inter-Club Business

There has been an update on the GDA (Game Developer's Association). There executive are on co-op so Alvin will try to coordinate a meeting.

BizTech has approached us. They want to see if we can help them financially and co-chair. We decided that we can't help them financially as it would not be in the best interests of CS students but we will definitely help them advertise.

### Department Business

We still don't know what to do with the glass plates. Put them in storage again. An option is to be creative and convert them to something else. Possibly glass tabletops.

Lockers Update: Department suggested we up the price to $60 for the term. Forestry offers lockers for $20 a year. They are near the Tim Hortons. There are lockers in the LS Klink building that were ours when we were there. No one has claimed them. We should look into that situation and possibly rent those out. Albert will look into pricing the lockers.
