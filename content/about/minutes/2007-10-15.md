8.  Post-discussion: LAN party, Halo 3 party, Tri-mentoring kickoff event
    LAN party: 12 people; hard to set up; need more people to participate
    Halo3 party: 40-50 people showed up, 24 people played

    - Hardware was provided; no one need bring their own
    - Advertisement targeted 3 groups: CS students; UBC video game competitor associate; UBC video game development associate

    Conclusion:

    1.  CSSS has too many events going on, but we don’t have good plan, organizing, and advertising.
    2.  We should focus on Slashdot party and Beer garden:
        Plan thing ahead (3 weeks);
        Lots of advertisement needed in advance: emails, poster, etc.
