1.0 Joint MIS IT Night

- Thursday or Friday evening in March, 5-9pm
- probably a Thursday in the first or second week of March
- consists of: presentations, dinner, networking game, open networking
- presentations -> CS/MIS professor talks about an issue, company delegates discuss how they address this
- networking game -> break the ice
- open networking -> also resume collecting? maybe at the discretion of company delegates
- last year was partially sponsored by Accenture/Business Objects, and partially subsidised by the Commerce Undergraduate Society
- will be held at the David Lam Forum unless we find a better place
- last year 50-60 participants, 10-20 of which were company delegates and alumni
- this year's theme -> data management
- costs mostly coming from the food
- business-formal attire
- if the idea of networking seems to intimidating the most CSers, refrain from advertising it as such
