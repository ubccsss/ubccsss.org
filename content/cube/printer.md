We have a printer available for public use location in the Cube. Our rates are
cheaper than UBC printers!

### Current rates

- 5¢ per black and white page
- 10¢ per color page

You may print by either using the public computer in the Cube, or by connecting
to [Google Cloud Print](https://ubccsss.org/print).
