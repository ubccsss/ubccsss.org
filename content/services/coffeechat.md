_Note: this program is TBD, and is not currently running. Check back in Term 2 of the 2021-2022 year for more info!_

CS Coffee Chat is a program that randomly pairs a junior (1st or 2nd year) student with a senior (3rd+ year) student for a quick meet-up on a monthly basis. This is a low-commitment and informal opportunity for junior students to ask questions about Computer Science majors, classes, extracurriculars, or internships and senior students to share their experiences! If more junior than senior students sign up, we'll make sure everyone is still in placed a match in a group of three - either in a group of three or with another junior student.

Make new friends and get to know other people walking around ICICS ☺️
