<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>Now that we have a winning logo for our t-shirt you could begin ordering your CS clothing for this year. Design #13 will appear on the front centre of this year&apos;s t-shirts and the Cube logo (Design #6) will appear on the left corner of the sweatshirts. You could either <a href="/files/OrderFormCorrected.pdf">download the order form here</a> or drop by the office to pick one up. The deadline for ordering is <b>November 4th, 2005 at 2pm</b>! (just ignore everything it says about October 28th)  Please note that this deadline will NOT be extended (well, we extended it once... but that was the last time ;-)) so make sure you get your orders in on time.</p>
<p>Clothing samples have also arrived in X139.  So make sure you have the right size for your order.  If you&apos;ve submitted an order form already and want to double check (since they only arrived really recently), just come down and we can make changes if necessary.</p>

<p>Please submit orders ASAP, as the sooner we get the orders in to our supplier, the sooner they will arrive!</p>
<p>EDIT: Order Form has been corrected.</p>
