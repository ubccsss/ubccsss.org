<p>Help solidify your own knowledge of the material, improve communication skills, gain volunteer experience, and help out a fellow student!  Don&apos;t be afraid if you think you won&apos;t be able to answer a question.  The student you are helping does not expect you to know everything!  You can always go to the Learning Centre and get additional help from a TA.</p>
<p><strong>Need a tutor?</strong></p>
<p>Get help with a difficult course!  If that&apos;s not reason enough (!!!) you&apos;ll get to meet another student who can probably give you advice on other CS related things, eg. courses to take, great profs, etc.  Remember though that they are a student like you so don&apos;t expect them to know everything!</p>
<p>If you&apos;d like to participate, here&apos;s how to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to www.csss.cs.ubc.ca</li>
<li>Create an account on the CSSS website or login with an existing account. </li>
<li>Click &apos;my account&apos; on the side bar</li>
<li>Go to the &apos;edit&apos; tab</li>
<li>Click &apos;UBC&apos;</li>
<li>Halfway down the page you can select whether you would like to request the help of a volunteer tutor, or you would like to volunteer as a tutor.</li>
<li>Enter the courses (or programming languages) you want help with, or you want to tutor in.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Email webmaster[at]csss.cs.ubc.ca if you have any trouble.)</p>
<p>We&apos;ll match you up and then let you go from there!  We&apos;ll also have fun informal social sessions for participants.</p>
