> 317 with Donald Acton is pretty fun. Networking is sort of my jam though, so I'm a bit biased. I found the text incredibly interesting. It's really the only instance of me in UBC reading a textbook leisurely just to learn more. You get to learn the protocol stack and how the Internet works! It's really amazing. I really wish there more assignments though. It'll give you experience with socket programming which is definitely an asset you want to have as a developer.
