Here you can find a collection of course reviews and descriptions from UBC students and TAs, sorted by year. Some have been sourced from Reddit and student websites. Students who are interested in contributing may edit the page with the "Edit on Github" link or fill the form to create a Github issue that will be reviewed by an officer.

_NOTE_: These reviews and descriptions are here as reference ONLY. Course content vary from year to year, so any materials on this website might be out of date. We are not responsible for any mistakes in the reviews and descriptions provided herein; however, we will accept notifications as such so we can place appropriate notices.
