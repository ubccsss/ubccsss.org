<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>We&#x2019;re passionate about web design. We want to spark a club offering web design services to other clubs, instructors, and professors, and to nurture a supportive community where fabricating good code and sharing ideas are just the starting point. To start, though, we need at least 5 more members. We&#x2019;re recruiting web designers and graphic designers, but if you just want to join, that&#x2019;s cool too. Email &lt;club [at] lfred [dot] info&gt; to join or to get more information.</p>
