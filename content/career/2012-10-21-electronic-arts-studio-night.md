Come and visit the EA campus, hear guest speakers, win cool prizes.  Free food and beverages provided!</p>
<p>Also, <b>Grace Lo</b>, formerly of UBC, will be there to share her experiences working for EA as a guest speaker.  You should bring your resume and transcript if you&apos;re interested in being a potential candidate to work for EA.</p>
<p>One interesting note is that transportation is provided (presumably from UBC to Burnaby) however you must contact UBC Career Services to reserve.  More on this as information becomes available to us.</p>

<p><b>EDIT: Late breaking news!  We tried our best :-)</b></p>
<p>Pick-up from UBC at 5:15pm and drop off at EAC (4330 Sanderson Way). The bus will be waiting at the UBC passenger drop off-pick/up loop just outside SUB on the North Side. The bus would enter through Gate 2 which goes to the loop and then back out Gate 2 again.</p>
<p>It is a white &quot;limo&quot; style bus. It should have a sign in the front window stating it is for EA.</p>
<p><b>Even more edits...</b></p>
<p>Return transportation is your own responsibility.  The best way to get back to UBC from EA is to catch the 25 UBC westbound at the corner of <u>Sanderson Way</u> and <u>Gilmore Way</u> (right outside EA) and follow it to UBC Bus Loop.  Buses arrive every 15 minutes... See <a href="http://www.translink.bc.ca">http://www.translink.bc.ca</a></p>
