<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>The Centre for Vision Research (CVR) at York University offers a one-week,<br>
all-expenses-paid undergraduate summer school on the topic of vision science.<br>
This year&apos;s program will be held from May 31 to June 6, 2009.</p>
<p>The program includes talks by CVR faculty members on current research topics in<br>
vision science, as well as hands-on projects in CVR laboratories.  The<br>
curriculum reflects the wide range of research areas at CVR, which includes<br>
basic research on vision in humans and animals, covering both neuroscience and<br>
behaviour, as well as applied topics such as computer vision, virtual reality,<br>
visual perception in low-gravity environments, and vision in clinical<br>
populations.  For an idea of the topics to be covered, see last year&apos;s schedule<br>
