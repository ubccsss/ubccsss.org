Attend summer school with no classes! Instead:
**
* Get hands-on experience with mathematical modeling
* Interact with students, faculty and industry sponsors doing research in teams
  on real-world problems of critical interest to industry
* Meet students from around the world while working in beautiful Vancouver, B.C.
* $2000 CDN scholarships available towards attending graduate school in B.C.
**
The MITACS Industrial Math Summer School is a new initiative aimed at providing
undergraduate students with an opportunity to do mathematical research in groups
on real-world problems. We will combine students from different academic backgrounds
in teams of four or five to work on problems submitted by local companies, research
labs and non-profit organizations. Each team will work for one month on one problem.
