The event will take place in Wesbrook Room 100 at 5:30 pm with refreshments served. Business Objects is interested in meeting undergrads who would like to learn about the career opportunities with this popular company. Due to the volume of emails we manage at the Career Centre, we cannot respond to individual questions about this Employer. You are welcome to visit their website for more details at <a href="http://www.businessobjects.com">www.businessobjects.com</a>. We hope you can join us in Wesbrook on the 7th.<br>
They will also be attending UBC&apos;s annual Career Days in SUB on Oct. 1st and 2nd so make a point of stopping by their booth for further career opportunity information.</p>
