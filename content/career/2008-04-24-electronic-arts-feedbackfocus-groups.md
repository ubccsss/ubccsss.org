Electronic Arts Canada is looking for local gamers/non-gamers of all ages to participate in our focus groups.

If chosen, you will be invited into our studio located in Burnaby to play games like: Need for Speed, Skate, Spore, NHL, FIFA, NBA Live, Fight Night, Facebreaker, and many other EA titles. Get the chance to provide feedback directly to the designers! No game design knowledge is required – just tell us what you think will make the game more fun!

For attending a focus group, you will be given a free game of choice. Pizza and drinks are also served during our sessions.
