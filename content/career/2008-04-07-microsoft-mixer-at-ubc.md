Microsoft wants to celebrate the end of term with you! We're coming to campus to talk about a few new initiatives going on as well as to give you guys free software. That's right, just for showing up, we'll give you instant access to a new program that Microsoft has just launched called Dreamspark. Show up this Thursday at DMP 110 to learn more about it. In the meantime, read up on it [here](http://school.whoischarles.com/content/microsoft-dreamspark-ubc) and [here](http://school.whoischarles.com/content/microsoft-really-targeting-college-and-university-studentsin-good-way).

Hope to see you all there!
