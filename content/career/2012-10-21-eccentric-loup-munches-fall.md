<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>One of the best kept secrets in the CS department is the weekly <strong>Eccentric Loup Munches</strong>.  There, young (and old) minds ponder the great questions and issues surrounding computing science and offer great insight over lunch and a snack.</p>
<p>Organized by <strong>Steve Wolfman</strong>, this event has lasted through the summer and is now scheduled to continue onwards through the fall.  As this is a weekly thing, we won&apos;t list all the topics that will be covered, however, you can check out their official website and scour the newsgroups (ubc.cs.undergrad (editor&#x2019;s note: now closed)) for more information. </p>
<p>The latest post as of this writing is here (editor&#x2019;s note: now closed).  So stay up to date and come out!  It would be a shame if someone solved the <a href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/">P vs NP Problem</a> at a weekly munch and you weren&apos;t there to witness it! :p</p>
<p>Official site: http://eccentricloupmunches.thruhere.net/ (editor&#x2019;s note: now gone).<br>
Date and time: <strong>ICICS/CS 206</strong> on <strong>Tuesdays from 12:30-2PM</strong></p>
