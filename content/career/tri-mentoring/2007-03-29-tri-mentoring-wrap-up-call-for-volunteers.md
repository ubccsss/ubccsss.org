Want to meet people from [MSFT](https://microsoft.com), [EA](http://ea.com), [IBM](https://ibm.com), [BOBJ](http://businessobjects.com), [Telus](http://www.telus.ca), [AAPL](https://apple.com), and [MDA](http://www.mda.ca)? Or just looking for a chance to gain more volunteering experience, show leadership & get involved in CS?

Either way, come join us to run the Tri-mentoring Wrap Up event on April 3rd evening.

To show our appreciation, the 3 volunteers will be given both:
- free catered dinner (reception food, better than pizza & pop)
- free T-shirt

The 3 volunteers will be registering mentors and mentees from 5:15-6:15pm. Then they are welcome to join us in the reception and social mingling afterwards until 7:30pm.
