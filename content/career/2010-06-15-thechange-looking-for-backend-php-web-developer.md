Passionate about using technology for social change‽ Want to be a part of the founding team of a promising start-up? If you are a self-motivated, entrepreneurial web developer then keep reading!

[TheChange](http://thechange.com/) is a media platform for sustainability engagement, in a local context. People use our platform to shop, work and study for change while organizations use TheChange to connect with a highly targeted and motivated audience interested in their sustainability initiatives and opportunities. We launched TheChange.com on May 15th with the participation of over 50 of BC's leading sustainable companies and NGO's. We have big plans for future development. It's an exciting time to join our team!

As the back-end development lead you will be responsible for hard coding and expanding the back end functionality of website. The current site was built in python/django, but now we're transitioning to PHP.

Your work will include both new developments and modifications to existing build outs—you should be comfortable writing code from scratch and reworking pre-developed functions and features. You'll be responsible for various additional tasks including bug fixes, server troubleshooting, and technical strategic input. You will work closely with our web design and marketing team members to develop and create a continually better customer experience. Growth and new challenges will be endless with this job as the company scales up at a continually faster pace.

This is not your regular 9–5 job. We are looking for someone who shares our vision, has an entrepreneurial spirit, a strong work ethic and is keen to be part of a start-up environment. If you are a motivated self-starter with strong interpersonal skills, and enjoy working in an agile and iterative development environment, then you'll fit right in.
