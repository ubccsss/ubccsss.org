Location: EAC (Burnaby Studio)</p>
<p><b>Last day to register is January 31st, 2007 </b></p>
<p>Come to Electronic Arts Canada to here about<br>
exciting research going on in Cognitive Systems<br>
at UBC and EA.  This is a great way to find out who&apos;s doing what,<br>
and maybe get some good ideas for that research you&apos;re going<br>
to have to do! (COGS students)</p>

<u>The event will have two parts:</u></p>
<p>- Part one will be presentations from COGS professors and students about research<br>
in the COGS fields (vision/visual HCI and Computation Intelligence/Behavioural Agents)<br>
and EA will have presentations on Athletic Performance (fixing the zombie problems),<br>
Wii controller HCI issues and HCI/UI design for the next generation.</p>
<p>- The second part of the event will be a social-networking event where students can<br>
mingle with EA employees. EA recruiters will also be around!</p>
<p>Students must contact Eric Lebeau (<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c0b4b7afa4a1b9b3a8a1a4afb780a8afb4ada1a9aceea3afad">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>) to register* for the event.<br>
*** Students must have membership in the Cognitive Systems Society (AMS club) to come.<br>
Membership is $5. </p>
<p>*Please note:<br>
COGS declared Majors have priority, then students who will have taken COGS courses.<br>
All others will be considered on a case-by-case basis. First come, first serve for<br>
this type of registration.  We have ~100-150 seats for students to fill, so there<br>
will likely be space for you.  The last possible date to register for the event is<br>
Jan. 31st to make sure that EAC&apos;s security has plenty of time to prepare.</p>
