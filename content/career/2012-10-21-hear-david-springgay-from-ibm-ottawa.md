<ul>
<li>Find out about the work being done in these labs and about the potential co-op and permanent opportunities with them.
</li><li>J9: the IBM virtual machine technology.  It runs on your palm.  It runs on your laptop.  It runs on the worlds largest supercomputers.
</li><li>Eclipse: an open source, extensible development environment with base support for java, and extensions for Aspect J, C++, web development, workflow, or anything you desire, even games.  This is the biggest threat to .NET  today.
</li><li>Websphere Integration Developer: a new product built on top of Eclipse, which offers tooling to create e-business applications in a service oriented architecture.  We push the envelope for visual programming.  You can author your application using graphical data, interfaces, executable flow charts, state machines, business rules, and visual snippets.
</li></ul>
<p>This is an excellent opportunity to find out about the work being done in these labs and about the potential co-op and permanent opportunities with them.</p>
