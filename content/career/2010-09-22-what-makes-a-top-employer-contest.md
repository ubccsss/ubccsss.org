Hey all,

As the sponsor of Canada's Top Employers for Young People 2010, KPMG wants to hear from students what they feel makes a top employer.

The student with the best answer will win 5, one hour meetings with 5 top executives to be announced from the list of Canada's Top Employer of Young People Award (http://www.canadastop100.com/young\_people/) and an iPad 3G.

The student with the most votes will win an iPad 3G.

We already have over 250 videos posted.

This is an opportunity for your students to be heard. All answers are being documented and a final summary of students' answers will be presented at the Top Employer's Summit November 1-2 in Toronto.
