Microsoft Developers are a little left of centre too. But, they&apos;ll still take you through a two-hour session and show you how to unleash your inner freak using Visual Studio&#xAE; Express Edition 2005 development system.</p>
<p>You&apos;ll see how fun and easy it is to design awesome looking games with the drag and drop interface. Web Page and Screen Saver starter kits mean you don&apos;t have to have a PhD in computer science&#x2014;again, if you&apos;ve got one, that&apos;s great. And the best part is, you don&apos;t have to spend a dime.</p>
<p><strong>You must <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/canada/events/event_details_ww.aspx?event_id=1032289527&amp;x=35&amp;y=10">register for this event</a> to attend.</strong> </p>
<p>The Develop Mental Tour is a complimentary 2-hour learning seminar aimed at students with an interest in designing and building games and web pages. Attendees will learn first-hand from Microsoft developer experts how Visual Studio&#xAE; 2005 Express Edition can quickly enable them to bring their ideas to life and create their own software in ways that are fun and easy. Web Page and Screen Saver starter kits mean a PhD in computer science isn&#x2019;t at all necessary &#x2013; but it certainly won&#x2019;t hurt.</p>
<p>Take the software home<br>
Everybody who attends the Develop Mental Tour walks away with either a voucher for software redemption or a complimentary copy of Visual Studio 2005 Express Edition. And, the first 250 to attend receive a complimentary Microsoft Press&#xAE; book. It&#x2019;s a no-brainer, really.</p>
