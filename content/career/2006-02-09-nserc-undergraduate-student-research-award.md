Would you like to get some research experience in an academic setting? If you are an undergraduate student with an interest in working on research and development projects at a University, you may be eligible to apply for an Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA). The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) subsidizes
eligible professors to hire students on their research projects, thereby creating interesting research related jobs and giving you the opportunity to gain valuable work experience.

### When:

Summer 2006, May - August (full time for 16 weeks)

### Who's Eligible:

NSERC USRA candidates must:

*   be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada;
*   be registered (at the time you apply) as a full-time student in a bachelor's degree program at an eligible university (exception: see graduating students below);
*   have obtained, over the previous years of study, a cumulative B-(68%) average or above;
*   have completed all the course requirements of at least the first year of university study (or two academic terms) of your bachelor's degree;
*   not have started a program of graduate studies.

In addition:

*   If you already hold a bachelor's degree and are studying towards a second bachelor's degree, you may still apply to this program.
*   You may hold only one USRA per fiscal year (April 1 to March 31).
*   You may hold a maximum of three USRAs throughout your university career.
*   If you are a graduating student, you may hold an award in the term immediately following the completion of all requirements of your undergraduate program, regardless of your graduation date. If you were only required to register part-time in your final term in order to complete your degree, you are still eligible to hold an award.
*   Once you start working, you must be engaged, on a full-time basis, in research and development activities in the natural sciences or engineering during the tenure of the award.

**Who is not eligible?**
You are not eligible for an undergraduate student research award if:

*   You are currently enrolled in an undergraduate professional degree program in the health sciences (e.g., M.D., D.D.S., B.Sc.N.);
*   **or** You hold higher degrees in the natural sciences or engineering.
