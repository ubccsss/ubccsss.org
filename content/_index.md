Welcome to the Computer Science Student Society, the student club for
undergraduates at the
[UBC Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/). We provide a
social space where everyone’s welcome (in ICICS 021), run events, and represent
your interests to the department. For more events you may be interested in, please follow us
on our social media outlets.
