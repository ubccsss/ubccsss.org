      If you want to become a game designer, I highly recommand this course. The team project will give you a solid support on your resume and in your interview. But if you want to learn modern engines like Unity or UE5, this might not be a good course. If you already joined this course, remember to find a good team!!! And I can tell this class is getting better every year, so if you see my comment from years later, do not be tricked.

      Course was composed of a project (60%) and 4 assignments (40%) in which you need to pass both the project and assignment portion of the course. Personally, the assignments took too much time away from the project and the assignment instructions were vague. However, the project was a blast if you have the right team.
