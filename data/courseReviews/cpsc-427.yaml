    review: |
      Course was composed of a project (60%) and 4 assignments (40%) in which you need to pass both the project and assignment portion of the course. Personally, the assignments took too much time away from the project and the assignment instructions were vague. However, the project was a blast if you have the right team.
    difficulty: 3.5
    quality: 4
