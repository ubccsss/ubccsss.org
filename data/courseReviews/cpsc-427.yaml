      Some of the course material overall is interesting, however the interesting parts are not covered in depth. The most trivial marks are taken off for assignments (which take a while). There is no final exam, pretty much just the project and assignments, so the most important part of this course is finding a "carry" for the group or else the project will be a bit annoying. C++ and OpenGL are used; if you aren't comfortable with OpenGL, then the assignments and project (without a carry) will be annoying, but doable (fonts, particle systems, shader effects like water).
      
      If you have already created a game before from scratch (not using an engine), then this course will not offer much.
      
      However, if you would like an introduction to videogame programming, this is a good a start.

      If you want to become a game designer, I highly recommand this course. The team project will give you a solid support on your resume and in your interview. But if you want to learn modern engines like Unity or UE5, this might not be a good course. If you already joined this course, remember to find a good team!!! And I can tell this class is getting better every year, so if you see my comment from years later, do not be tricked.

      Course was composed of a project (60%) and 4 assignments (40%) in which you need to pass both the project and assignment portion of the course. Personally, the assignments took too much time away from the project and the assignment instructions were vague. However, the project was a blast if you have the right team.
