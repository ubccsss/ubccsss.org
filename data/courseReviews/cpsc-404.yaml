      Course is taught well but the material becomes complicated pretty quickly. Took it w Ed Knorr and he had a student-friendly grading policy (3 midterms with worst one being replaced by your final if the latter is better). Each midterm was a month apart and no major assignments that take over your weekends. You could get 13% right-away on the course via clickers, In-Class/Pre-class exercises that are graded based partially on effort and correctness. 
      
      
      **Note for the dev team:
      This is like a (awesome) curated version of RMP! Would be useful to see which profs teach a given course and filter by prof to see how ratings/difficulties change!
