      I had Steven, his teaching was excellent, he is clearly and effective in everything he teaches. The course is modularised very effectively. I wish there was more skepticism on OOP and there is a heavy reliance on the debugger and other IDE tools which is not great. The content is engaging and the "fliiped" lecture style is really helpful, especially since Steven will sit down next to you and help you through problems in a really helpful way. He is also helpful if you ask questions that reach outside the exact course content. I would reccomend coming in with some experience in java or other (non-racket) languages, the concepts are important.

      Excellent course. Lectures are easy to follow, all practice materials  and labs are highly relevant to lecture materials, and term project allows students to problem-solve independently.

      Well-structured course. Concepts covered are very valuable for the workplace, job interviews, and general software engineering. Instructors are attentive, engaging, and fun. Felix especially!

      Its a Software development course. You build a project over the course of the semester and learn about program design. Lecture content is pretty simple but there is a large time commitment due to the project. Great introduction to software development.
