      Well-structured course. Concepts covered are very valuable for the workplace, job interviews, and general software engineering. Instructors are attentive, engaging, and fun. Felix especially!

      Its a Software development course. You build a project over the course of the semester and learn about program design. Lecture content is pretty simple but there is a large time commitment due to the project. Great introduction to software development.
