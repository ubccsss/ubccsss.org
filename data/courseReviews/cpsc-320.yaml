      Very useful code to get you a job in the industry. Helps you in almost all Data Structure and Algorithm questions.
      Please start your assignments on time.

      Strikingly similar to CPSC 121 in terms of course structure, but on more advanced topics (e.g., DP, greedy, etc.). Course was well ran and assignments were challenging, but fair.
