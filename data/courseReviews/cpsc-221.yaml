      An introductionary course into algorithms and data structures, such as sorting algorithms, and linked list. The class covers the basics, so not a lot of prior knowledge is required. Most importantly, this is the first class that introduces asymptotics notation (big O notation, like `O(n)`) and using them for algorithm analysis formally, so this could be handy for job interviews. You also learn about C++ and pointers.
