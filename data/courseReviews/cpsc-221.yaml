      Typical DSA course and therefore very important material is covered here. Changed the way I think about coding by giving me tools and concepts to better reason about it. I loved the programming assignments. I felt that they challenged me but at the same time were fun. The other assignments aren’t as fun and interesting imo but are still good. The examlet structure is great in my view. There is some research showing frequent low stakes testing is superior to a handful of big tests. I was apprehensive before taking this course because I’m a product of the traditional way (a few big tests), but this course converted me.

      Enjoyed the course and the way it was structured. Content is pretty interesting and not too bad to learn, but the assignments can be challenging. All in all good course with goated profs.

      Great intro to Data Structure and Algorithms course. Prepares you for basic Technical interviews. Loved the prof (Cinda Heeran) and rate her 5/5.

      An introductionary course into algorithms and data structures, such as sorting algorithms, and linked list. The class covers the basics, so not a lot of prior knowledge is required. Most importantly, this is the first class that introduces asymptotics notation (big O notation, like `O(n)`) and using them for algorithm analysis formally, so this could be handy for job interviews. You also learn about C++ and pointers.

      Introduction to algorithm design. The course can be difficult and the assignments can be time consuming. Make sure to study well for this one.
