      Great intro to Data Structure and Algorithms course. Prepares you for basic Technical interviews. Loved the prof (Cinda Heeran) and rate her 5/5.

      An introductionary course into algorithms and data structures, such as sorting algorithms, and linked list. The class covers the basics, so not a lot of prior knowledge is required. Most importantly, this is the first class that introduces asymptotics notation (big O notation, like `O(n)`) and using them for algorithm analysis formally, so this could be handy for job interviews. You also learn about C++ and pointers.

      Introduction to algorithm design. The course can be difficult and the assignments can be time consuming. Make sure to study well for this one.
