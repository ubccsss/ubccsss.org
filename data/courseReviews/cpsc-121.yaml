      Undoubtedly, 121 is an interesting course; however, the class teaching/learning doesn't directly correlates to the exam difficulty levels.

      The course was logical and no coding was required. Tutorials are super helpful to gain a better understanding on the course material. In labs, we worked in pairs and it was a good experience to meet new people in CS but it was a definitely a time crunch. Make sure to set aside plenty of time for assignments.

      Interesting course that is actually more about logic rather than actual programming. Not too hard, but definitely requires a lot of studying

      Covers extremely important CS and mathematical concepts, but I found the course to be poorly structured *compared to* other CS courses. Material in labs seemed completely unrelated to lecture. Professors are great though, funny, caring, hold excellent office hours. Course can be quite challenging for those who struggle with logical thinking. Find a good assignment partner!!

      Did not like this course personally. A lot of proofs and boolean algebra. Also Hated using LaTeX for the assignments.

      - important topics
      - course content can be difficult like the proofs
      - there is a big time investment needed to do work and have solid understanding

      The course covers a wide range of material, including propositional logic, proofs, and circuit diagrams. I found the course pace and progression quite reasonable. I especially enjoyed the labs - the content builds up from simple AND gates to simulating an entire CPU. Assignments and tutorials are very useful for building a deeper understanding of the topics!
