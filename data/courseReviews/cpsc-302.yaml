    review: |
      Material felt fast-paced during lecture time (especially when you have to pick up new linear algebra definitions and understand how decomposition techniques work at an underlying level), but the proofs and problems weren't too difficult. Marking tended to be generous. Best advice to do well is to stay on top of the material so you have time to do problems during exam season. This was a truly uninteresting and dry class though.
