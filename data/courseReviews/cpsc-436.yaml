      CPSC436A OS DESIGN & IMPL
      Excellent course overall. I consider this is one of the few courses I have ever taken at UBC where my tuition actually pays off. 
      You will obtain hands-on experience developing an Operating System in this course, also you will find out how little and shallow you understand OS from courses like 313. Here is the course website https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~cs-436a/.
