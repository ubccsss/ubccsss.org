      This course teaches a lot about how computers work on the hardware side and how low level code works. Fun course that teaches you a lot but not an easy one for sure. I liked the concepts of deadlocks the most. Took this course with Robert Xiao and had a great time!

      Was quite fun. Assembly was a bit annoying at first, and it remained annoying unfortunately. But, It was interesting. I recommend to all CS students.
