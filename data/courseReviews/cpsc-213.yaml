      what I took away was the foundational relationships between how hardware was designed and how software programming languages are built on top of one another.

      topics in my term
      - assembly and hardware-to-software design
      - using c and java to abstract parts of hardware instructions
      - asynchronous code

      This course teaches a lot about how computers work on the hardware side and how low level code works. Fun course that teaches you a lot but not an easy one for sure. I liked the concepts of deadlocks the most. Took this course with Robert Xiao and had a great time!

      Was quite fun. Assembly was a bit annoying at first, and it remained annoying unfortunately. But, It was interesting. I recommend to all CS students.
