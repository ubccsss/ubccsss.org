    review: |
      An ethics course focused on discussion about ethical problems within the tech sector. Took the course with Kevin Layton-Brown and Giulia Toti. Each week, there is a paragraph that you need to write (approximately 1500 characters (not words)), which will be peer-graded later. Depending on your previous amount of weekly work, you peer-grade 3 or more of your fellow peers' paragraphs (anonymously). No programming involved, but a lot of writing. Something to keep in mind if you find your writing skills are not as strong.
