      Great courses specially you are taking it with Margo. Course content is managed well on PrairieLearn. A lot of programming assignments especially the second half of the course. 
      
      Systems can be messy but you will learn a lot for sure

      Very well-organized course with most assessments on PrairieLearn. Course content is pretty difficult though.
