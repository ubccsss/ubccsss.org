      This is a cheat code for those wanting to get high level CPSC credits. It is 6 credits, with the work of a 3 credit course. It is completely project based (work in a interdisciplinary team), so no exams or anything, and so has an extremely high average.
      
      Furthermore, you get access to a cool building (CDM) and there are some high level companies that request projects there (Huawei, etc.), however chances are it will be a relatively small company / startup. Your teammates are doing Masters degrees, so they are pretty chill, a bit older, and come from a variety of industries.
      
      The project is completely random; I created an educational videogame for example in Unity.
      
      There is an emphasis on visualization based projects, so if you have those in your application, you will have a good chance of getting in.
