      The lecture content is not that hard. The main project though is very tedious and if you do not know TypeScript or Promises then there is a very steep learning curve. Try to give a lot of time to the project and start early!

      Easy but annoying because the class material is different from the project. The project is also super terrible (by design) so it's a pretty big waste of time.
