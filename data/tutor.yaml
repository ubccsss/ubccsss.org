    I am a passionate cs student who recently completed third yr honors. I tutored and TAed for 320, achieved the second highest mark on the final exam for 340 (1), and the highest integer-rounded overall mark for the course (2).

    95% in 320
    96% in 340
    96% math + cs average

    I like to teach difficult concepts in an easy-to-understand way, without relying on using big words or fancy definitions that only confuse people more. I always prioritize understanding and reasoning over memorizing answers to past assessments. I will teach the exact problem solving technique/procedure that I used to solve every single question on the tests when I took those courses. Anyone looking to improve their skills and solve harder problems from these courses should look no further.

    Sources:
