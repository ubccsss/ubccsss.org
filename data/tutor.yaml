Depending on your needs, I have a structured plan to clear your concepts and prepare you for exams. I have also tutored several students since then who passed with good grades.

    I am a passionate cs student who recently completed third yr honors. I tutored and TAed for 320, achieved the second highest mark on the final exam for 340 (1), and the highest integer-rounded overall mark for the course (2).

    95% in 320
    96% in 340
    96% math + cs average

    I like to teach difficult concepts in an easy-to-understand way, without relying on using big words or fancy definitions that only confuse people more. I always prioritize understanding and reasoning over memorizing answers to past assessments. I will teach the exact problem solving technique/procedure that I used to solve every single question on the tests when I took those courses. Anyone looking to improve their skills and solve harder problems from these courses should look no further.

    Sources:

    I graduated from UBC in 2022 with a combined Computer Science and Microbiology/Immunology degree. I was a CPSC 213 TA for 3 terms (2020-2022) and have 6 years of experience as a tutor high school and university students privately. I averaged 97% over all my CPSC courses during my degree (CPSC 110, 121, 210, 213, 221, 313, 310, 320, 330) and was selected as the UBC Computer Science Valedictorian Speaker for Spring 2022. I am currently a 3rd year medical student at UBC and still have a passion for computer science and teaching students.

    CS graduate and have been working as a Software Engineer for 7 years in USA and Canada. I have primarily worked with Java and Python. But, I am familiar with a host of other languages including C, C++, C#, Go and Kotlin.

    I started tutoring as student in 2013 and have found it to be quite rewarding. My approach to teaching is focussed on breaking down concepts into simple ideas that make sense. I adapt the style and speed of tutoring to the pace that the student prefers.

    I have considerable experience with Algorithms, Data Structures, Databases, Design Patterns, Software Engineering and a host of programming languages. I can also help provide career guidance (academic as well as industry) as well as more specialized training that helps you get hired by tech companies.
  rates: $45 per hour
  availability: All days of the week - contact to schedule.

    Hi! I'm a 4th year CS student. I had fun in these courses and scored A/A+ in all of them (90 in CPSC 320, 89 in CPSC 314, 87 in CPSC 330). Would love to help other students with any difficulties in understanding.

    Additional Notes:
    - I can meet on campus or do an online tutoring.
    - Specify what exactly you need help with even if it's a different CPSC course or some MATH course, I'm more than happy to help!
