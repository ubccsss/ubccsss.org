              The UBC CS Student Research Conference (CSSRC) is taking place for
              the first time on Friday, February 27, 2026.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is to celebrate and advance graduate and undergraduate
              research in computer science by providing an inclusive,
              professional conference where UBC students can present their work,
              engage with academic and industry leaders, and build networks that
              foster innovation and career development. The CSSRC is
              fundamentally by students, for students, with the goal of
              empowering students to contribute to and partake in the research
              community early in their careers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The event will feature a poster and paper submission track, with
              faculty and senior graduate student reviewers, modeled after
              established conferences. Selected submissions will have the
              opportunity to showcase their work during the conference in a
              poster session, and some winning posters and papers will receive
              awards!
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the event will host a

              competition, a research career panel, research presentations, and
              networking opportunities.
            </p>
