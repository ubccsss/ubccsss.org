### Add a new event

Create a new event from the template using the `hugo new` command. Replace "2021-01-01" with the day of the event, and "cool-event" with the URL for the event. The URL should be lowercase.

```shell
hugo new events/2021-01-01-cool-event.md
```

#### Important folders

##### `content`

Contains content files corresponding to every post, event, and page.
The `events` folder contains events which can be added to a student's calendar,
and the `posts` folder contain general posts to display.

##### `data`

YAML files with some data used elsewhere in the site, including the Cube's
address, images for the 3D cube on the homepage, and social media links.

##### `layouts` and `themes`.

HTML template files for the site. The
[hugo-bootstrap](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-bootstrap/) theme is used as a
base for the site. Files with the same name in the `layouts` folder override
files in the `themes/hugo-bootstrap` folder.

##### `static`

Static files that are copied into the website with no modifications. Images and
PDF files are placed here.

#### Headers and Redirects

HTTP [headers](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers/) can be set by editing the `static/_headers` file.

Short links and other [redirects](https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/) can be configured in the `static/_redirects` file. If you want to redirect to another page on the site, you can add a `aliases` item to the metadata.

### Environments

The site has three environments:

- `development`: This enviroment is used for development.
- `preview`: The enviroment used for previewing the site on [Netlify deploy previews](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/deploy-previews/)(previews for merge requests).
- `production`: This enviroment is used for production.

Each environment has its own environment variables accessible in the `config` folder.

#### Config folder

The `config` folder contains the following folders:

- `_default`
- `development`
- `preview`
- `production`

`_default` contains the base configuration files, and depending on the environment, the files in the other folders will be automatically merged into the base configuration if `_merge: deep` is added to the base file.

`hugo server` runs the site in development mode by default.
`hugo` builds the site in production mode by default.

Read the [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/) for more information on how they work.

#### Environment variables

Currently, there are three enviornment variables:

- `recaptchaSiteKey`: reCAPTCHA key for courses databse new review form
- `workerURL`: Cloudflare worker url for courses databse new review form
- `gcseURL`: Google custom search engine url for searchbar
- `CFBeaconData` : Data required for Cloudflare Analytics, which only includes our token for now

#### netlify.toml

netlify.toml contains the configuration for the Netlify. `HUGO_ENV` is used to select the environment for different Netlify environments.

### Build

To view the site locally, you need to clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ubccsss/ubccsss.org.git
```

You'll also need to
[install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). The current
version of Hugo used is listed in the [`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml) file, under
the key `HUGO_VERSION`.

Then to view the website in your browser, run Hugo and open up the link:

```bash
â–¶ hugo server
